( afp , santiago ) after the supreme court ruled that the former chilean dictator pinochet is mentally incompetent and unfit for trial , the aging pinochet may never have to face the various charges of human rights violation during his 17- year rule . attorney gutierrez pointed out that the closing of the case of " death caravan " is not due to the lack of evidence but due to the defendant 's lack of mental competency . the prosecuting lawyers said that they would continue their efforts to bring to justice other suspects who participated in the assassination operation , but they noted that the supreme court 's ruling may affect their prosecution of pinochet in other cases . pinochet took power following a bloody coup in september 1973 in chile . he said : " this means that pinochet is not exonerated , nor deemed innocent or that his case has been rejected for lack of evidence , but rather that he is unfit for trial due to his mental disease . " he was accused of dispatching a squad to carry out summary executions of opposition leaders in various parts of the country . a total of 75 people were assassinated .

democratic national committee spokesman cabrera fired the first shot yesterday , issuing a statement that accused bush of emphasizing favorable economic statistics while ignoring the potential pain likely to be caused by higher interest rates amid high levels of credit card debt . democrats say the bush administration is glossing over problems in the economy and the threats posed by higher rates . bush , kerry camps search for spin on fed rate hike white house spokesman mcclellan , speaking just before the quarter - point boost by the federal open market committee , said such a move would be a sign of a reinvigorated economy . a widely expected rate hike by the federal reserve turned quickly to campaign fodder as president bush and presumptive democratic nominee kerry used the move to highlight their economic views . " it 's a reflection that the economy is growing stronger . " " it 's not unexpected that as the economy continues to grow stronger that interest rates may rise some , and that 's not something at this point that is a concern , " mcclellan told reporters . kerry economic advisor sperling said the campaign " respects the independence of the federal reserve " and would not comment directly on interest rate decisions . the federal reserve announced yesterday it was raising its target for the federal funds rate , which commercial banks charge each other overnight , to 1.25 percent from a 1958 low of 1.00 percent . " over the long - term , economists estimate that bush 's fiscal policies would raise long - term interest rates by about one percentage higher , meaning a typical family would have to pay 1,200 dollars more for a home mortgage and 120 dollars more for a student loan each year , " said sperling . but he noted , " the real issue is that bush 's abandonment of fiscal discipline will mean higher long - term interest rates , less sustainable economic growth and more debt passed on to our children .

in contrast , the six - year - old democratic party of japan , the largest opposition party , has gained momentum due to results from pre-election poll . his approval rate declined drastically last month when he told us president bush , without consulting the public or parliament , that the japanese troops in iraq would stay on as part of the un forces after the restoration of iraqi sovereignty . the poll suggested that the party would win more seats in the upper house election than the liberal democratic party . with the upper house election coming soon japanese prime minister koizumi faces toughest challenge although no unexpected election results would lead to a change of government , analysts say that if the ruling liberal democratic party fails to top its pre-election strength in the upper house , koizumi could still face pressure to step down . japan will hold upper house election on sunday to express general public opinion on prime minister junichiro koizumi 's pension system reforms and his controversial policy to post troops in iraq . but if the party gets fewer than 45 seats , most analysts consider koizumi 's position would be jeopardized . it looks unlikely that the liberal democratic party of which koizumi is a member can reach its original target of 51 seats and it is projected to secure only 48 seats . however , he came under fire after his ruling coalition forced the passage of the unpopular pension reforms legislation last month . since he took office in april 2001 , koizumi has rode out two national elections and several by - elections with his promises to push government reforms and relatively high popularity . koizumi 's support for the us - led war in iraq and his decision to send troops to iraq , although these japanese troops are on non-combat missions , have also proved unpopular with many voters . the legislation aims at cutting pension benefits and raising premiums to address the problem of aging population .

" chinese foreign ministry spokesman kong quan on july 25th refuted the pentagon report as groundless , which claimed that china 's annual military spending was about 65 billion us dollars instead of the official figure of 20 billion us dollars . beijing to invite report writer criticizing china to visit mainland the invitation to be issued by the npc 's foreign affairs committee was another sign of anger china showed over the two us reports issued two weeks ago . ( afp report from beijing ) the chinese authority announced that it hoped to invite the writer of two us strategic reports it regarded threatening the world peace to visit the chinese mainland to clarify the " misunderstandings " . zeng jianhui said that some of the us congressmen only knew little about china , " they misunderstand china 's development and we must offer them opportunities to make them better know our goodwill to the world 's peace .

( newspaper clippings ) less than 20 percent of buildings in beijing meet requirements for lightning protection however , recent statistics released by the beijing center for detecting the safety of lightning protection showed quite astoundingly that less than 20 percent of organizations or buildings across the city had comprehensive lightning protection measures in place that fully met requirements . beijing , july 18 , ( xinhua ) the lightning - strike disaster in china has become a major public hazard for the electronic age , and continuous thunderstorm weather recently has made this danger imminent . according to estimation by relevant departments , there are averagely 2,000 thunderstorms per minute around the world , and more than 10,000 people globally are injured or killed by lightning strikes each year , and fires or explosions are frequently caused . thunderbolt disaster is one of the ten worst natural disasters named by the united nations , and at present it 's among china 's top ten natural disasters . lei zhenfa , a senior engineer at beijing center for detecting the safety of lightning protection analyzes that , there are three major reasons that lead to thunderbolt disasters : first , both organizations and individuals lack awareness of lightning protection , thinking they are incidents of remote probabilities and trusting too much to luck ; second , their concept of lightning protection is obsolete , thinking one lightning rod can help avoid all thunderbolt disasters . while many buildings have measures that prevent cloud - to - ground lightings , they have no precautions against lightning electro-magnetic pulse , which results in serious losses caused by lightning strikes on weak - current equipment ; third , buildings are themselves " inherently defective " . wire poles in many residential areas are entangled with power cords , telephone lines and cable television lines , and the layout cannot meet the technical requirements for lightning protection . once struck by lightning , it may lead to an extensive region - wide thunderbolt disaster . according to a report by the china youth daily on the 18th , there are more than 30 lightning - strike disasters in beijing each year , which usually occur to computers and communication systems , or ancient and public buildings .

" new zealand 's conservation minister carter proposed to study methods of " human hunting " , saying , " despite a moratorium on commercial whaling operations , countries like japan , norway and iceland continue to kill thousands of whales annually , and the methods used in whale - killing are often very brutal .

indonesian president megawati defies critics and polls in bid to remain leader after the pdi - p lost 40 percent of its vote to finish second in the april 5 parliamentary polls , many analysts believed the presidential race would be a battle of the two generals -- yudhoyono and wiranto . written off by pundits and opinion polls , indonesian leader megawati has been relatively successful with a stronger than expected showing in indonesia 's first presidential polls , which is credited to the diehard support of loyalists from her indonesian democratic party of struggle ( pdi - p ) as well as her high profile as the incumbent leader . megawati , with 26 percent , seems likely to be the only candidate against yudhoyono in the second - round at the expense of wiranto ( 22 percent ) . but while yudhoyono is the clear leader after nearly 60 percent of the votes have been counted , he has only 34 percent support -- well short of 50 percent needed to avoid a september runoff . most importantly , most pdi - p voters apparently stayed loyal to megawati in the country 's first direct presidential election . the taciturn megawati , widely seen as aloof and neglectful of ordinary people , has recently worked hard to reverse the perceptions during the month - long presidential campaign . she held occasional press conferences and visited markets and other centres to mingle with the public . the us national democratic institute said just 13 percent of pdi - p votes went to yudhoyono . but 31 percent of golkar members voted for yudhoyono rather than for their official candidate wiranto . 
patients ' symptoms vary due to the difference of the falling myelin in the nerve tissues . impaired vision , balance problem and tremors may be some of the symptoms . when myelin loses its sheath , the scars will result in sclerosis . with the development of the disease , new scleromas may appear . as a result , it is called multiple sclerosis . researchers speculate that immune cells , called t cells , can secrete inflammatory molecules . the cause of the disease is still unknown . however , in tissue culture studies , statin drugs can effectively slow t - cell proliferation to curb nerve lesions . these molecules eat away the myelin outside the nerve cells . in addition , statins are easier to use : they can be swallowed , whereas beta interferon has to be injected . the report also points out that in terms of brain repair , statins appear to rival the beta interferon , but their price is only 1/10 of the latter . ( international ) simvastatin may cure multiple sclerosis simvastatin is a cholesterol - lowering statin drug often used for treating heart disease . xinhua news agency report of may 14th from london ( by staff reporter cao lijun ) - american researchers say in a report in the latest lancet magazine that cholesterol - lowering drugs , which were often used to treat heart disease , could help to curb the brain lesions of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) patients , bringing some hope to them . half a year later , these patients had a 40% reduction in brain lesions . during the experiment , researchers from the medical university of south carolina gave 30 ms patients daily doses of simvastatin . such fibers , like intricate electrical wires , make up a complicated network in the nerve center . human nerve cells have many limb - shaped nerve fibers . myelin can not only protect the " nerve electrical wires " from short circuit like the plastic coating of an electrical wire , but also can speed up the conduction of nerve signals . nerve fibers are coated with a substance called " myelin " .

such reports were unexpected to tunisian readers but it is obvious that the newspaper is trying to tell its readers that tunisia is already out of the competition of bidding for the 2010 world cup . ( sports ) tunisia still bidding for 2010 world cup after fifa decided to hold the 2010 world cup in africa , tunisia formally presented its bid in may 2003 and then offered the idea of co-hosting the game with libya in order that the two countries could " share their own advantages " . xinhua news agency report of may 13th from tunisia ( by reporter zhang youhao ) - " tunisia has not given up its bid for the 2010 world cup . the recent reports about it are not true , " tunisian football association information officer shalvas told a xinhua reporter in a telephone interview on the 13th . shalvas said over the phone that the tunisian football association had sent a letter to the fifa solely to explain its stance on the bid and had not announced its withdrawal from the competition . however , fifa president blatter has made it clear several times that japan and south korea 's co-hosting is only an exception and fifa will not consider the issue of co-hosting in the future . according to tunisia 's daily newspaper on the 13th , tunisia 's current stance is still to co-host the game with libya as fifa rules do n't forbid co-hosting and there has been the precedent of japan and south korea . he also revealed that the president of the tunisian football association , ben ammar , was now in zurich , switzerland to make the last efforts for tunisia 's bid . the headline of a relevant report in the private daily times on the 13th reads " two days away from the zurich voting : a battle between south africa and morocco " . over the past two months , tunisian media have not reported on the bid for the 2010 world cup , with only a little coverage on it being seen in the past two days . 
( international ) us dollar slides on new york foreign exchange while japanese yen is put under pressure during the trading session of new york foreign exchange on the same day , the market basically followed the technical trend , almost unaffected by the leading economic indicators and other economic data released by the united states . xinhua news agency , new york , april 19 as greenspan , chairman of the us federal reserve board , will make an important speech this week , investors appeared relatively cautious . on the 19th , the us dollar against major european currencies fluctuated slightly on new york foreign exchange and slid a little bit at closing , while the japanese yen suffered a complete sell - off due to a frustrated japanese stock market . however , the japanese yen declined across the board on the day as japan 's stock market took quite a deep dive on the 19th and its domestic investors kept selling japanese yen for foreign currencies to buy overseas assets after japan entered a new fiscal year in april . as market participants generally expected to look for the future direction of the us interest rate from the key speech greenspan will make this week , they were not enthusiastic about entering the market . the recent statistics about employment , retailing and inflation successively released by the united states continuously fueled the market 's expectation that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates within the year . at the closing of new york foreign exchange , the euro against the us dollar went up to 1:1.2017 from 1:1.1992 the previous trading day ; the british pound against the us dollar rose to 1:1.8083 from 1:1.7982 ; the us dollar against swiss franc dropped to 1:1.2894 from 1:1.2944 , while the us dollar against the japanese yen rose to 1:108.46 from 1:107.67 . some market analysts think that since low interest rates have been the major factor that affects the exchange rate of the us dollar , the us dollar may go stronger even further once the us federal reserve decides to raise the interest rates soon . 
meanwhile , the consumer prices , which rose to their highest levels in 7 years , was up 3.8% in april on a yearly basis . china could raise interest rates as early as july april saw stronger - than - desired figures , which had added to speculation that the central bank will raise one - year lending and deposit rates for the first time in nearly a decade as fixed - asset investment and credit growth continue to boom . economists say china could raise interest rates as early as july to cool its sizzling economy after april data showed few signs of a slowdown . however , a securities analyst said that china would likely wait for the us federal reserve to move on us rates first because a premature hike on the mainland would add to speculative pressure on the yuan , already under strain from hot money flows . the current lending and deposit rates stand at 5.51% and 1.98% respectively . he has forecast a rate hike after the federal reserve meets at the end of june . " the people 's bank of china is likely to raise interest rates after the us federal reserve has adjusted its own monetary policy , " he said . the chinese economy has not slowed since it was hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) outbreak in the second quarter of last year , recording growth of 6.9% in the first quarter of 2004 , 9.9% in the fourth quarter of last year and 9.1% for 2003 as a whole . talk that china must raise rates reached a climax this week as the economy continued to surge ahead , with industrial output for april rising at the same pace as march , while money supply remains well above the government 's 17% annual target .

the report claimed that the use of hard x - rays and the diffraction enhanced phase contrast imaging technique to observe and take pictures of such a tiny tissue inside a fish is a first in the world . according to the explanation , since the wavelength of a hard x - ray is even shorter , its penetration capacity is naturally stronger ; while the diffraction enhanced phase contrast imaging technique can detect the phase distribution of an organism and is able to show three - dimensional information on a plane photograph , it is especially effective in the differentiation of the tissue boundary . experts believe that through these techniques , it is expected to " expose " an early stage cancerous tissue from a normal one and win more treatment time for patients . ( selected newspaper collections ) microscopic technology for taking pictures of small fish capillaries brings hope to early cancer diagnosis according to the report in the jiefang daily , the shanghai institute of optics and fine mechanics of the chinese academy of science revealed a few days ago that they used hard x - rays with a stronger penetration capacity than regular ones to successfully observe and take pictures of a capillary that was 30 microns in diameter inside a small fish . xinhua news agency , beijing , may 26 - the newest observation technology used in a 2cm - long small fish with black fins and a white belly might be able to save the lives of tens of thousands of cancer patients . this small fish is 6mm wide and less than 4mm thick . this experimental result is expected to advance furthermore the diagnosis of initial stage cancers . " a normal x - ray is incapable of discovering such a capillary . " from the photographs provided by the institute of optics and fine mechanics , this winding capillary connected the fish 's air bladder with its head . the shanghai institute of optics and fine mechanics collaborated with the imagery center of the beijing synchronous radiation lab in using a hard x - ray with a 0.087 nanometer wavelength and a diffraction enhanced phase contrast imaging technique , resulting in an image resolution rate that could " perceive the minutest detail " with a maximum capacity of 10 microns . chen jianwen , the researcher responsible for this research explained that x - ray computerized tomography ( ct ) is usually used in clinical medicine to determine the pathology of a biological tissue . nonetheless , compared with a normal tissue , the difference of absorbing the x - ray by an initial cancerous tissue is extremely small , making it impossible to reflect the absorption on an image . thus , it is very difficult to diagnose an initial stage cancer .

experts say regulating hate speech on the internet remains extremely hard experts attending the conference on internet media freedom organized by the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) agreed today that it was almost impossible to control or punish hate web sites . as the lawsuit between us internet giant yahoo and a french group trying to stop the online sales of nazi souvenirs entered a new phase this week , experts from various nations who gathered in amsterdam for the conference on internet media freedom stressed that it was extremely difficult to regulate hate speech on the internet . the norms are not consistent even within europe , and presently only france , germany , belgium , austria and switzerland have laws that criminalize the acts against humanity , said akdeniz , a professor at leeds university in britain . " the internet is global and it 's not at all possible to develop a global norm , " said lipson , a former advisor to the united nations and president of the article 19 organization , which is dedicated to safeguarding the freedom of speech . pro-nazi or racist web sites can just change the country of registration to bypass some laws and norms , but web surfers around the world can still browse such sites , even including people in countries which have formulated more strict laws on hate speech . compared with europe , racist thoughts can be more freely expressed in the united states because the us constitution explicitly guarantee the freedom of speech , and the us authorities can only intervene when someone is intentionally inciting hatred and there is a risk that leads to immediate violence . it is an obvious consensus among many experts attending the amsterdam conference that the earnest wish to regulate and punish hate sites must not lead to excessively harsh rules that would strangle freedom of speech . the council of the european union has been trying to set norms for punishable hate speech on the internet , but many experts say the vague definitions offer no help in effectively regulating hate sites .

scientists said that dust tornadoes on mars are of much larger magnitude than on earth . the largest martian dust tornado may reach 10 km in height . this principle is somewhat similar to the phenomenon of thunder and lightning . in the thin martian air such high voltage is enough to ionize air molecules to form lightning . they generate huge voltage with the strength of electric field up to 20,000 volts per meter . scientist are worried that dust tornadoes will complicate the mission of exploring mars even more because lightning can destroy computers and electro-statically charged dust particles also tend to damage instruments and equipment . ( international ) popular science : dust tornadoes may generate high - voltage electricity , posing nuisances for mars exploration this new discovery has scientists worried that similar phenomenons on mars may give rise to lightning , which can pose an unexpected nuisance to future missions of exploring mars . xinhua news agency , beijing , april 26 swirling columns of dust may occasionally occur on the vast empty surface of the ground under a blazing sun , and they can generate very high electric voltage . for example , under the sun the temperature of the asphalt road is very high while the temperature of the surrounding sandy land is relatively low . the difference between the temperatures at the intersection of the road and the sandy land causes the air to spiral up , bringing with it the dust to form a dust tornado in the shape of a column . this swirling column of dust called dust tornado is created by the uneven temperature of the ground surface . in the most recent issue of the journal of geophysical research , william farrell , a scientist at nasa 's goddard space center , reported that in the past few summers he has been studying the phenomenon of dust tornadoes in the desert in southwest united states and discovered that high electric voltage can be generated inside a dust tornado and the potential difference between two points one meter apart may exceed 4,000 volts . small dust tornadoes vanish within a few minutes , while some dust tornadoes of large size may last one to two hours . lighter dust particles tend to be negatively charged and carried upward by air currents in a dust tornado , while heavier dust particles tend to be positively charged and sink , resulting in potential difference . the research found that the voltage is formed by charged dust particles . 
in summary the report asked : " the question remains : who is in charge of intelligence ?

" the above report was released on the second day of hearing . the report accused tenet of failing to develop a set of management strategy for global intelligence so as to assist in winning the war on terror . in addition , tenet mainly focused his energies on the cia rather than coordinating and integrating overall us intelligence operations .

" the vaccine was almost certainly used throughout the soviet bloc and was probably exported to china , japan and several countries in africa , " the british science weekly reports in next saturday 's issue . this meant that for nearly 20 years after sv40 was supposed to have been screened out , the soviet union continued to ship potentially infected vaccines to its eastern european allies and elsewhere . after the polio vaccine was invented in 1955 , pharmaceutical labs used cells from rhesus monkeys to prepare doses in commercial quantities . " that means hundreds of millions could have been exposed to sv40 after 1963 . " it was supposed to have been eliminated from all new vaccines worldwide . in 1960 , sv40 was found in monkeys and soon after was detected in injected polio vaccines .

whether with shells or not , mollusks ' weight usually decreases by 40 percent to 80 percent due to vicious survival conditions resulting from water shortage . it is relatively harder for mollusks with small shells or without shells . they have to bury themselves in the soil , and some species can reach as deep as 35 centimeters underground . when in water , they breathe solved oxygen in the water with cheek or lung . when out of water , they will absorb oxygen directly from the air to meet their body requirements with the blood vessel system close to the body surface . russian researchers also discovered that the way aquatic mollusks breathe also changes when out of water . ( international ) popular science : why out - of - water aquatic mollusks can survive long experts from russian severtsov institute of ecology and evolution found out its mystery recently . they found that aquatic mollusks can adapt to the new habitation through new energy consumption and breathing methods soon after getting out of water , enabling them to survive a long time . moscow , august 23 , xinhua ( reporter wei zhongjie ) normally , aquatic animals die soon after getting out of water . however , many aquatic mollusks can survive pretty long after thrown onto the shore by waves or in other out - of - water situations . for this purpose , they can excrete a special mucus that is distributed around the body surface to prevent their bodies from dying . according to the report by russian magazine science news , out - of - water aquatic mollusks need to keep their body moist at first for further survival . it 's much easier for mollusks with big shells . these mollusks gather in clusters on shady spots , such as under rocks or reef cracks , so as to achieve better moisture retaining effects of mucus . under such enclosed conditions where oxygen and food are short , the chemical contents in their bodies change and nutrients and oxygen in the bodies are consumed . since they can enclose their bodies by closing up shells , water inside bodies can be retained from vaporizing to keep body moist .

scientists said that in the future it may be possible to determine the on - off status of all genes while sulfate - reducing bacteria are corroding metal . these genes are believed to play an important role in bacteria 's metal - reducing capabilities . results of similar studies will be necessary in order to seek more effective ways to prevent metal from microbially influenced corrosion . ( international ) us maps the genome of a bacterium that corrodes oil and natural gas pipeline us scientists have newly mapped the genome of a key sulfate - reducing bacterium , which will help find a solution to this old challenge . xinhua news agency , washington , april 14 ( reporter mao lei ) the corrosion of pipelines by microbes such as sulfate - reducing bacteria has been an old challenging problem that bothers oil and natural gas production and delivery industries . sulfate - reducing bacteria , a type of anaerobe , can reduce sulfates to sulfides and in doing so corrode the underground metal pipeline through chemical reaction . scientists at the institute for genomic research in the united states chose desulfovibrio , one of the most common sulfate - reducing bacteria , for sequencing . in an article in the online version of the new issue of the journal " nature biotechnology " scientists said that they have sequenced a total of about 3.6 million base pairs of this desulfovibrio and conducted a preliminary study of its genome . similar microbially - influenced corrosion can not only destroy pipelines and equipment but sometimes also trigger accidents , causing the oil and natural gas industry to suffer huge economic losses . for example , after scientists analyzed the genome of this bacterium , they have identified a network of cytochrome c proteins . they think these results can be used for further study of the functional mechanism of bacteria in metal corrosion so as to develop new strategies to reduce the damages by sulfate - reducing bacteria .

they put exclamation marks where there had been question marks and i think that is hyping , a spin , that leads the public to the wrong conclusions . " blix told the bbc in an interview , " i think it was a spin that was not acceptable . british investigation report assails intelligence agency but sparing blair blair immediately responded with willingness to accept responsibility for any mistakes but insisted the us - led war to overthrow iraqi president hussein last year was not unjustifiable . a published official british investigation report assailed the pre-war intelligence on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction but noted prime minister blair had not deliberately misled uk into war . he noted that though it seemed " increasingly clear " hussein might not have had weapons of mass destruction ready to deploy before the war , that did not make the war a wrong effort . " iraq , the middle east region , the wider world is a better and safer place without hussein , " an unyielding blair said at the parliament hall . however , the investigation report concluded that an important document released by the british government in september 2002 , accusing iraq of having weapons of mass destruction , " showed no evidence of deliberate distortion or of culpable negligence " . the investigation report led by former top civil servant lord butler has effectively uncovered that britain rashly joined the war in iraq based on " seriously flawed " and " unreliable " evidence . former head of united nations weapons inspectors in iraq , blix said he telephoned blair in february 2003 , to warn him of his serious reservations over britain 's intelligence on iraq and described the document that the british government released as being " hyped " . butler reiterated at a news conference that while there had been negligence in terms of intelligence , " the government had no deliberate attempt to mislead " .

cheung the deputy secretary general mr law kam - sang papers address the hong kong academy for performing arts annual report july 1993 to june 1994 secretary for recreation and culture : mr president , i am happy to present the 1993-94 annual report of the hong kong academy for performing arts ( the academy ) together with its financial statement and auditor 's report to the council today . this report covers the year ending on 30 june 1994 . the past year has seen major changes in the top management of the academy . however , the academy has continued to deliver quality training to its students under the fine leadership of mr lo king - man , m . b.e. , j.p. , who has replaced dr john hosier , c.b.e ., as director of the academy . the pursuit of the highest international standards remains the aim of the academy . in this regard , the academy has benefited from the wide professional experience of its teaching staff . the international experience and contacts of the three new deans in the schools of dance , music and technical arts ( theatre ) who have joined the academy during the year has also helped to attract renowned visiting artists to work with the students . the value of such exposure is enormous in encouraging and stimulating the development of the students . in 1993-94 , there were a total of 586 full - time tertiary students and 812 part - time junior students . recognition of the talents of the academy 's students has been demonstrated by the substantial audiences for the academy 's concerts and performances and the numerous invitations to perform at overseas events . recently , for example , the academy 's students represented hong kong in the ceremonial and cultural events of the 1994 commonwealth games in canada . they have done extremely well in promoting the image of hong kong internationally . furthermore , during the 1993-94 academic year , 27 students won prizes in various local and international competitions . as regards academic programme development , in september 1993 , the schools of dance and technical arts ( theatre ) admitted their first year of bachelor of fine arts students . to date a total of four degree courses are being offered . the school of technical arts is now working on the development of another degree course in tv / film . it is estimated that the course may be introduced in 1996 . i am impressed by the tremendous progress made by the academy over the past 10 years since its establishment . the academy now plays a very important role in the local performing arts scene . today , there is no area of performing arts activity in hong kong which is not touched by the academy 's students , graduates or staff . looking forward , i am sure that the academy will continue to make a significant contribution in raising the standard of performing arts in hong kong and to be an institution of which we in hong kong can all be justifiably proud . finally , i would like to take this opportunity to add a special word of appreciation and thanks to dr helmut sohmen , o.b.e. , who retired from the chairmanship of the academy council on 31 december 1994 . during his eight years ' outstanding service , dr sohmen led the academy through a critical period of growth and development to attain its present status as the foremost degree - awarding institution in southeast asia for professional education and training in the performing and related technical arts . this is an excellent achievement and provides a sound legacy to mr yao kang , o.b.e. , j.p. , who succeeded dr sohmen as chairman in january 1995 . i am sure under mr yao 's capable chairmanship , the academy will be moving from strength to strength in the years ahead . oral answers to questions disclosure of particulars of legislative councillors ' assistants 1. dr david li asked : mr president , from 1 january 1995 , executive councillors must disclose their shareholdings in local companies and their activities in local financial markets . however , such disclosure is made to the governor only on a confidential basis in order that the rights of executive councillors to a reasonable degree of privacy for themselves and their families in respect of their personal finances are not significantly eroded . by contrast , legislative councillors are now required to disclose , for public inspection , not only the salaries paid to individual staff members but also their identities . in view of this , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the reason why the erosion of privacy consideration does not apply equally to legislative councillors ' assistants who are private citizens of the territory , neither appointed nor elected to public office , nor members of the civil service ; and ( b ) how the right to privacy and the personal safety of legislative councillors ' assistants will be protected in view of the disclosure of their identities and salaries for public inspection ? chief secretary : mr president , i do not consider that the analogy that the honourable member has made is a fair one . members of the executive council make very similar public declarations to those made by members of this council . they have agreed that , as advisers to the governor , they should make further disclosures to him personally of their assets and financial activities . that is something that we should applaud . the proposal that legislative councillors should now disclose the identities and salaries of the staff they employ with public funds seems to me an entirely different issue . to address the specific questions that the honourable member has asked , the consideration of a possible erosion of privacy in disclosing the names and salaries of members ' assistants must be weighed against the legitimate right of the public to know how legislative council members are using the allowances provided to them out of public funds . an independent commission , which was appointed by the governor at the request of members of this council to review the remuneration package for legislative council members , concluded that in this consideration the public interest should be paramount , and that legislative council members should include the names and salaries of their individual assistants in their reimbursement claims , which should be made available for public inspection . the administration agrees entirely with the commission 's view that the public has a right to know how legislative council members use their allowances and that the approach taken in this area should be one of accountability , credibility and transparency . there is no reason why a major item of expenditure , in this case staff costs , should be exempted from this public scrutiny . i frankly cannot see how the personal safety of legislative council members ' assistants will be threatened simply because their names and salaries are made available for public inspection . indeed , some legislative council members have been disclosing the names and salaries of their assistants from the beginning , even when this disclosure was not a requirement . i am not aware that these members - or their staff - have experienced any such difficulties as a result . dr david li : mr president , in response to beijing 's request for information on civil servants , a government source was quoted as saying , " the chinese side has to spell out clearly what kind of information it wants and who would have access to the files before the government would consider providing that information " . the spokesman was further quoted as saying that " even if the request is made , the government would have to consult the official before handing over the files " . by contrast , the government has moved more than swiftly to disclose the personal information of legislative councillors ' assistants for public inspection , without so much as the courtesy of consulting those who are directly involved . is the government aware that in so doing a double standard has been applied between the treatment of the civil servants and the private citizens of hong kong ? president : it is a very long preamble to your question , dr li . chief secretary , reply if you can . chief secretary : mr president , i do not think that the preamble to dr li 's question is relevant at all to this particular point in question . the government has taken the advice of the commission appointed independently to review this matter . the commission 's report has been discussed and agreed by the administration and members have been fully consulted on the recommendations before the financial package on the remuneration has been approved since october last year . of course the commission has taken all the views into account , including the views members made through their working group to the commission . the commission had come to the conclusion that , in this particular case , since the allowances payable to members for staff costs , among other things , are public funds , it is important that the public should be able to see for themselves the names and salaries of the assistants employed by members using public funds . this is only a matter of credibility , accountability and transparency . i am sure the government and this council fully endorse the need for this accountability and transparency . and i do not believe that there is anything to hide from making these known to the public who pays for the funds through tax revenue and other public sources . dr philip wong : mr president , will the administration inform this council whether it will require members of the executive council to disclose information about the salaries of their assistants ? if yes , when will such a requirement take effect ? if not , why not ? chief secretary : mr president , executive council members already have a register of members ' interests which is made available for public inspection , covering land and properties , companies in which they have a beneficial interest , payment of directorships , employment and financial sponsorship . the same applies to members of this council as this council also has a register for public inspection . members of the executive council also , of course , may have their own personal assistants but they are not paid from public funds . so the question of public scrutiny does not arise in that particular case . perhaps i should return to the point , mr president , that members ' assistants are paid from the allowances from public funds . this is why the question of public scrutiny comes in . for other payments which are not paid from public funds , the question does not come in , as it is in the case of executive council members ' assistants , if any . mr martin lee : mr president , in relation to those assistants who were already employed by certain legislative council members before the relevant commission had come up with this recommendation for disclosure , does the government not see that by requiring these legislative council members now to disclose the personal details of these assistants would be totally unfair to both employers and employees , and in certain cases may even amount to a breach of contract ? chief secretary : mr president , the breach of contract does not arise in this case because the package of recommendations is to take effect from the next financial year . the only bit which is to take effect now concerns the names and salaries of the assistants of legislative council members and this has no financial implications . as regards the revealing of such names and salaries of the staff , i think that some legislative council members have already done that and there are no particular problems arising from those disclosures . i cannot understand or see how the other members and their assistants will have any particular inconvenience arising from such disclosures . i think in the end the members themselves must judge whether it is in the public interest to do so and if so , it is upon them to explain to the public , who pay for these allowances , why this has to be hidden from the public as such . dr leong che - hung : thank you , mr president . i do realize that executive councillors and legislative councillors serve different roles , but at least in this particular session , many legislative councillors are also appointed by the governor , just like executive councillors . can the administration clarify for this council whether executive councillors , in declaring their assets and financial activity , only have to disclose the information to the governor while members of this council have to disclose it to the public ? if that is the case , why is there a double standard ? chief secretary : mr president , as i said earlier on , executive council members , like legislative council members , declare in the register of members ' interests land and properties , financial holdings of companies and so on , which is available for public inspection , in the same way as members of this council have done . in addition , members of the executive council , because of their position as advisers to the governor , also declare a further list of disclosures involving their financial interests . these disclosures involve personal shareholdings in hong kong companies and any positions that members occupy in their own right in the hong kong futures exchange . these are matters which , of course , are beyond what legislative council members have to declare and they are matters which executive council members declare to the governor only , as advisers to the governor , to ensure that the governor gets the independent and impartial advice in case of any conflict of interest . they are in addition to the present list of registers which are applicable to both executive council members and legislative council members . so the question of double standard does not come in at all here . mr peter wong : mr president , i question the chief secretary 's logic that just because a few members have chosen to disclose the information necessarily means that what is done is right or should be mandatory for others . mr president , it is well known that the legislative council working group has a different view to the commission on this disclosure problem . now does the immediate enforcement by the administration of all the recommendations of the commission not mean that deliberation by the working group of the legislative council has become a total waste of time and a fait accompli ? chief secretary : mr president , i think members of this council have already had discussions on these matters with the commission and with the administration . the recommendations made by the commission have been accepted by the administration and the financial package for the first stage of these has been approved by members of this council in finance committee . if any particular member or members have any particular strong views on any of these procedural requirements , i am sure of course the commission would be happy to look at them again in the light of any practical problems arising from such implementation . but i think that the same will apply to those members who have already done so without any problem . the question then is , why is it that other members see difficulties in such a procedural requirement ? at the end of the day , it must be for the secretary general of this council , who is the controlling officer , to satisfy himself that the funds earmarked for reimbursement are discharged properly and that the director of audit must of course also use his power to scrutinize such discharge of responsibilities under the audit ordinance . mr andrew wong : mr president , i want to follow up the questions asked by mr martin lee and mr peter wong . mr lee 's question was very specific . he asked the administration to give a reply on the issue of disclosing to the public the name and salary of each assistant . mr lee 's question is : in certain cases , disclosure may amount to a breach of contract because a member , as employer , and an assistant , as employee , might have agreed to keep the information confidential at the time when the relevant employment contract was first entered into . the chief secretary has not answered the question properly . i believe mr wong also wants to ask the same question . in the case of a breach of contract under such circumstances , how will the administration deal with the matter ? i hope the acting chief secretary will answer . chief secretary : mr president , if there were real difficulties in this particular area of contractual obligations , i am sure the controlling officer will be listening very carefully to such problems and consider how best to resolve this matter when it comes to reimbursing the costs of these staff payments . president : we have a queue of questions . i will take three more in order of priority . mr chim pui - chung : mr president , personally , i fully agree that legislative council members have the duty and obligation to disclose the relevant information to all residents in hong kong . however , since assistants have nothing to do with public interest , should not they be consulted first before the disclosure ? moreover , will disclosure cause assistants to compare salaries , thereby giving pressure to members to raise their assistants ' salaries , with the result that hong kong residents become the ultimate losers ? would the administration take this factor into consideration ? chief secretary : mr president , as i said , if there are any real difficulties which members cannot overcome , i am sure the secretary general , who is the controlling officer , must consider these carefully , and if necessary , will reflect to the administration or the commission in resolving these difficulties . mr cheung man - kwong : mr president , staff of statutory organizations fully - owned by the government , such as the provisional airport authority , the mass transit railway corporation , and the kowloon - canton railway corporation , do not have to disclose their salaries , although some of them may have salaries exceeding $1 million a year . assistants to members are neither civil servants nor public officers , but just because they are paid out of public funds , they are not consulted when their privacy is compromised by the disclosure of their salaries . is there a question of a double standard ? is this unfair to members ' assistants who are but ordinary citizens themselves . chief secretary : mr president , i do not think the comparisons are valid at all . we are talking here about allowances payable from public funds to members ' assistants . this is why it is necessary to ensure that the public has a right to know and the way members use their allowances must be transparent and credible . when you talk about companies or corporations operating on prudent financial principles , the commercial considerations apply in those cases . it is important to bear in mind that in those operations , in indicating the salaries or remuneration of the staff in those corporations , it is important that the market has to be taken into account . market forces will of course affect the recruitment and retention of staff in those corporations and it is a different set of circumstances applying to those situations . this is why it is important for these corporations , for example , the monetary authority , the airport authority and so on , not to reveal the remunerations of the holders of those positions as they are , as it were , competing with the market in recruiting and retaining people of good calibre . so it is important to bear in mind the difference between these corporations and members of this council employing assistants with public funds . they are very different circumstances . mrs peggy lam : mr president , will the administration inform this council whether members of the executive council also draw allowances from the government ? do such allowances come from public funds ? if they pay their assistants out of public funds , why do they not have to disclose the particulars of their assistants ? chief secretary : mr president , members of the executive council do not get any salaries or allowances from the government . they receive honorarium just as what members of advisory boards and committees do and we do not require such information to be disclosed because they are honorarium . and it is not the practice to disclose these honorarium payable to members and how they are to be used by members . 50th anniversary of the end of the pacific war 2. mr jimmy mcgregor asked : will the government inform this council whether : ( a ) it will take steps to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the pacific war in august 1945 and pay tribute to the sacrifice and courage of the people of the territory during the war years ; and ( b ) it will organize a suitable programme to give thanks for deliverance and to express renewed hope for a peaceful and successful future ? secretary for security : mr president , it is our intention that this important anniversary should be suitably commemorated . arrangements for this are now well advanced . last year , at the governor 's request , the commander british forces established a steering committee to draw up proposals . its members include the president of the hong kong prisoners of war association and representatives of the british forces and the government . the governor has now approved a full programme of events recommended by the committee , and we have sought provision for this in the 1995-96 estimates . the programme will begin on 28 august . veterans from all over the world are expected to attend . there will be a commemoration parade , a wreath laying ceremony , a service and a march past by the veterans , the british forces and the hong kong disciplined services . the royal air force and the government flying service will also stage a fly past . there will also be a lunch for the veterans and guests . over the remainder of the week , there will be a battlefield tour , visits to significant military sites , such as the cemeteries , stanley fort and the former sham shui po prisoner - of - war camp . the programme will end on 2 september with a parade to mark the disbandment of the royal hong kong regiment ( the volunteers ) . mr jimmy mcgregor : mr president , will the government consider , inter alia , the following additional measures to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of hostilities in the pacific war : first , government encouragement to those organizations in hong kong which represent both civilian and military resistance to the japanese attack and occupation of hong kong from december 1941 , in the organization of meetings and religious services to commemorate the end of hostilities ; such encouragement to include financial support for such meetings and functions ; and also that the government shall be prepared to assist appropriate hong kong organizations which propose to bring representatives of other asian ex-servicemen 's associations to hong kong for commemorative meetings ; second , that the government does its best to encourage the japanese emperor and the japanese government to make a symbolic gesture of regret and penitence for the cruelty and misery inflicted on hong kong people from 1941 to 1945 ; thirdly , that renewed efforts be made by the hong kong government to secure british nationality and passports for the 25 or so wives and widows of hong kong volunteers and others who fought so valiantly for hong kong during the japanese attack and afterwards ; and finally , that a special committee be set up to consider and co-ordinate such commemorative activities which should give hong kong people every opportunity to express their gratitude to those who did so much for hong kong during those sad and dangerous years ? president : have you got that list , secretary ? i am sure you will want some of the points repeated . secretary for security : thank you , mr president , i will try to cover the four points asked by the honourable member . as regards the first point , will the government give encouragement to organizations in hong kong to participate in the celebration ? the answer is yes . as far as i am aware , the steering committee chaired by the commander british forces has encouraged organizations to participate in the arrangements for the organization . if there are organizations which are not presently involved then i would be happy to hear from them and will see that they are referred to that steering committee . as regards the request to seek an assurance from the japanese emperor , the object of the commemoration is for the people of hong kong and for those from overseas who fought for its defence and eventual liberation to , as the words of the principal question read , pay tribute to the sacrifice and courage of the people of the territory during the war years and to give thanks for deliverance and to express renewed hope . i do not think therefore that involving the japanese emperor falls into that category . as regards the third part - british nationality for the wives and widows in question , i think , as members of this council are aware , we have sought support for the sentiments expressed by that supplementary question from the british government and that continues to be our objective to seek additional assurances for these ladies . as members are aware , all of them have been offered british passports . the problem arises in that they have to go to britain in order to receive them , to fulfil the residency requirements . we have worked with some of the organizations in hong kong recently , in order to give these ladies further assurance in the form of a personal letter from the home secretary to each of them and a number of them have taken up the offer that he made to have a chop in their passport which will guarantee them entry into the united kingdom for the purposes of residence and subsequent citizenship . i am happy to say that with the help of some of the organizations here , we have managed to contact all of those who are in hong kong and we are now seeking those who are outside hong kong . as regards the fourth part of the question , mr president , the answer is again yes . hong kong people will be given an opportunity to participate . it is a very difficult matter for us to try and estimate how many will be involved and it is largely a matter of guesswork to figure how many people will be involved . but perhaps if i could link that to the first part of the question , any other organizations that can help us in that regard , we would welcome that advice . mr jimmy mcgregor : mr president , could i have clarification of the final point please ? does that mean that the government will entertain requests by suitable organizations for assistance and help if they wish to participate in these commemorative activities to the extent that they might be given financial help as well ? secretary for security : mr president , i fear not . the arrangements which we are making for the celebration which will take place in september is for the celebration . no participants are being offered any financial help , even those from overseas . we would be happy , as i have said in reply to the first supplementary , for any hong kong people to be involved in the celebrations in any way . that will not , i fear , go as far as providing financial help to them . but perhaps i could explain that it will cover such things as transport , it will cover such things as medical attention during the celebrations and all of the activities , and it will cover any of the celebrations to which they are invited and the refreshments and other activities . mr jimmy mcgregor : mr president , could i have further clarification as to what the secretary means by transport ? does he mean transport from another country to hong kong or simply vehicles inside hong kong ? secretary for security : mr president , it is the latter . we are not providing transport for anyone to visit hong kong or indeed subsidizing transport for anyone to come to hong kong . it is transport within hong kong . mr szeto wah : mr president , this year marks not only the 50th anniversary of the end of the pacific war but also the 50th anniversary of china 's victory in the war of resistance against japan , which is even more significant to the chinese people . will the government inform this council whether the commemorative activities organized by the government will also touch on china 's victory in the war against japan ? secretary for security : mr president , i think that the activities sought by the honourable member will be included in the series of events that we are organizing as part of this commemoration . they begin on 28 august and run through to be completed on 3 september . there will be a number of activities taking place during that time . rather than reading out the list , mr president , i will be very happy to provide that list to the member if he wishes . public transport services 3. dr samuel wong asked : according to the annual traffic census - 1993 report , the provision of public transport increased by just 25% over a 10 - year period from 1983 to 1993 . however , it was pointed out in the report of the working party on measures to address traffic congestion that the number of daily trips had doubled in the last 20 years , whereas the population had only increased by one - third over the same period and the proportion of trips using private transport had increased by nearly 50%. in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the reasons why the development of public transport services lags far behind the market demand ; and ( b ) whether the inadequate provision of public transport services has led to the increasing use of private transport by the public , thus aggravating the problem of traffic congestion ? secretary for transport : mr president , may i first point out , with due respect to the honourable member , that in his preamble he has not compared like with like . firstly , figure 5 in the annual traffic census - 1993 report depicts a 25% growth in the number of passenger trips made by public transport over the period 1983-93 . these figures do not relate to carrying capacities of the different modes of public transport over the same period . secondly , the number of daily trips referred to in the report of the working party on measures to address traffic congestion includes journeys by both public and private transport over a 20 year period . i now turn to the two specific questions asked : ( a ) the provision of public transport has not lagged behind demand . on the contrary , new services and major improvements have been introduced in the past 10 years . the mass transit railway ( mtr ) island line came into operation in 1985 , the light rail transit system commenced in 1988 , and the mtr extended its services from lam tin to quarry bay via the eastern harbour crossing in 1989 . in addition , the number of franchised bus routes rose from 275 to 469 and the number of green minibus routes from 109 to 231 . during this period , 18% of the franchised bus fleet and all public light buses and taxis have been air conditioned . ( b ) i do not agree that the tremendous increase in private car ownership experienced in recent years has been caused by inadequacies in our public transport system . the fact is that public transport in hong kong remains one of the best and most efficient in the world . as has been the case elsewhere , the growth in car ownership is mainly related to increases in real incomes . private car usage will always be more comfortable and convenient than public transport , and if people can afford it , they will aspire to own cars . mr president , i wish to assure honourable members that the administration is not complacent and , indeed , this is demonstrated by firm plans to further expand and upgrade public transport services . for example , the recently announced railway development strategy provides a blueprint for the expansion of our rail systems . meanwhile , both rail corporations are investing in new signalling equipment to increase train frequencies as well as in station improvements . the franchised bus companies will spend $500 million on new buses in the next 12 months . and further improvements will be made to ferry services to service the northwest new territories and the outlying islands . dr samuel wong : thank you , mr president . would the secretary for transport agree with me that the lack of parking facilities at major transport interchanges or underground stations for private car owners to park and ride on public transport is further aggravating the problem of traffic congestion ? secretary for transport : mr president , i do agree with the honourable member that we need to look afresh at the requirement for park - and - ride facilities , and indeed for some of the new developments in conjunction with the airport railway system . the mass transit railway corporation has suggested ideas in this respect and we shall continue to explore to see whether further sites can be made available for park - and - ride . mr chim pui - chung : mr president , in paragraph 3 of his reply , the secretary for transport said that franchised buy companies will spend $500 million on the purchase of new buses in the next 12 months . how many buses can be bought with this sum of money ? is cmb one of the bus companies being referred to ? since the negotiations on cmb 's franchise renewal may not be successful , is the administration implying that some new bus companies might take over its place ? secretary for transport : mr president , insofar as expansion of bus services and routes are concerned , we do consult the district boards and the figure of $500 million is the total which the bus companies plan to spend in the coming year . as for the exact number of buses , i cannot give a figure but i would imagine that this is about 200 buses or so . as regards the question on the china motor bus franchise , with respect , this is outside the context of this question and because negotiations are ongoing , i cannot answer that at this point in time . mrs miriam lau : mr president , in paragraph 2 of his reply , the secretary for transport said that the provision of public transport has not lagged behind demand . will the secretary for transport clarify whether the existing provision of public transport is already adequate to meet the demand of the public , especially during rush hours ? besides , with regard to the report of the working party on measures to address traffic congestion , has the government assessed how many private car owners would switch to commute on the public transport system if its recommendations are implemented ? how much additional pressure will thus be exerted on our public transport system ? and , what plan do public transport companies have to deal with such circumstances ? secretary for transport : mr president , i think it is very difficult to be precise as to say what caters for public demand . i think certainly during rush hours , a limited waiting time is to be expected at bus and train stations , at ferry services and so forth . the public transport operators cannot plan to have a fleet simply to cope with peak hour rushes . if we are to do so , the cost of public transport would be phenomenal . insofar as meeting demand today is concerned , the fact is that 9 million of our 10 million daily passenger / commuter trips are met by public transport and i think if one adopts this yardstick , it is fair to say that we do cater for public demand . having said that , i did indicate in my main reply that we are continuing to look at ways and means of improving our very good public transport services . mrs miriam lau : the second part of my question please . whether an assessment has been made ? secretary for transport : i am sorry . could the honourable member please repeat that question ? mr miriam lau : my question is : with regard to the report of the working party on measures to address traffic congestion , has the government assessed the pressure thus created on the public transport system if its recommendations are implemented ? how many private car owners would switch to commute on the public transport system ? have public transport companies worked out any plans in relation to the situation ? what are their plans ? secretary for transport : mr president , we have not made an assessment in respect of such a yardstick . but i think i should point out that in our working party report to tackle traffic congestion , our prime thrust is to contain the current position , insofar as traffic and traffic congestion is concerned . we are not out to reduce the existing fleet of vehicles . our plans are to try and contain growth in vehicles in the interim years pending the introduction of electronic road pricing . mr edward ho : mr president , in his reply , the secretary has ignored one important fact , that is , most people who use private cars do so because they live in areas poorly served by public transport . will the secretary inform this council what the government intends to do and indeed what it can do to ensure that regular , frequent and comfortable public transport is provided to these areas to offer a reasonable alternative to private car users ? secretary for transport : mr president , i do agree with the honourable member that , in the more remote parts of the territory , public transport may not be provided as regularly as one would have hoped . in respect of the new territories , for example , of course we have plans for the airport railway and when this is in place it will provide much relief for the nathan road corridor . secondly , there is ongoing dialogue with the bus companies to provide feeder services to the more remote parts of the new territories , and we shall also work with the hong kong ferry company to expand ferry services to the outlying islands and the northwest new territories . mr peter wong : mr president , the secretary 's answer addresses how to meet demand with various modes of transport . has our transport policy struck at the root of the problem , that is , to locate one 's residence close to both work and recreation , thereby avoiding unnecessary journeys ? secretary for transport : mr president , i believe that as part of the territorial development studies , this particular problem is being reassessed . in planning terms , we do look at transport and housing and we try to provide all the facilities in the same new town . dr tang siu - tong : mr president , the government seems to think that the growth in the number of private cars is the main cause of traffic congestion . can the government tell how many additional roads have been added to our road networks over the past 10 years ? can the increase in the kilometres of roads catch up with the growth in population and the need for transport ? secretary for transport : mr president , i find that a very difficult question to answer . i do not think it is possible to really correlate the increase in the kilometres of roads with the growth in cars , but suffice it to say that in fact the growth in vehicle fleet , particularly in the private section , has increased a third over the last three years . mr wong wai - yin : mr president , in paragraph 2 ( a ) of his reply , the secretary for transport said that the provision of public transport has not lagged behind demand . however , long waiting queues are observed at many bus stations during morning rush hours , particularly at some new towns in the new territories . the development of residential coach services in recent years seems to indicate that bus services cannot meet public demand . mr president , while there has been an increase in the number of gmb routes over the past 10 years , the growth in the past few years has slowed down quite a lot . can the secretary for transport tell whether there are any plans to increase the number of gmb routes , and whether the government will consider the idea of permitting gmbs to operate between housing estates in the new territories and the urban areas as a means of encouraging private car users to use gmb services ? i want to ask this question because of the fact that many people still have to stand for more than one hour during the entire journey from the new territories to the urban areas although they can get on board at a terminus . as a result , many people are unwilling to take buses . but if there are gmbs operating from these housing estates to the urban areas , i believe that some private car users will be attracted to take gmbs . i wonder if the secretary for transport will consider the opening of these housing estates to gmb operation ? secretary for transport : mr president , the number of residential coach services indeed has increased over the past 10 years . for example , there were 23 routes and there are now 83 and the total fleet deployed is 399 today as compared to 58 some 10 years ago . as for minibuses , our policy is to freeze the number of minibuses on the roads and the figure is now 4 350 . our policy is to switch operations from red minibuses to green minibuses and at the end of 1994 , there were 252 green minibus routes . the answer to the honourable member 's question as to whether we will continue in this direction is yes . but i think we have to bear in mind that we do not impinge upon the franchise rights of the public bus operators . president : not answered , mr wong ? mr wong wai - yin : my main question is : during morning rush hours ; many people have to keep standing throughout the whole journey even though they get on board at a bus terminus . the gmb routes mentioned by the secretary for transport just now are only local routes . what i have proposed are outbound routes , which run from public housing estates in new towns to urban kowloon . this may induce some motorists to take minibuses . i wonder if the secretary for transport will take this into consideration ? secretary for transport : mr president , the capacity of public buses does include a volume for standing passengers but certainly we will continue to look into the proposal suggested by the honourable member . but as i have said , we have to make certain that we do not impinge upon the franchise rights of the public transport operators because if we did so , this would mean increased costs . land disposal programme 4. mr albert chan asked : there were occasions in the past few years when some of the sites in the land sale programmes had not been sold as planned . will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the total number of sites in the 1994-95 lands sales programme not yet sold to date together with the total area of these sites and their respective usage ; and what steps will be taken to ensure that these sites will be sold as planned within this financial year ; and ( b ) whether there are discrepancies between the actual and anticipated selling prices of the sites sold this year ; if so , what the reasons are ? secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr president , ( a ) to date only two sites put up for sale by auction this year failed to sell . the total area of these sites is 1.07 hectares : one was for industrial use and the other for residential . in respect of the industrial site , the area will be made up by other sites . the residential site will be put up for sale again in march 1995 with an increase in the site area . the government will seek to ensure full utilization of the agreed land disposal programme hectarage as far as possible . ( b ) there have been no instances of discrepancy between actual and anticipated selling prices of sites sold so far this year . mr albert chan : mr president , i have learned that the residential site at shatin was sold this afternoon . let me first offer my congratulations to the government . under the 1994-95 land sales programme , the sino - british land commission agreed on the disposal of 26 hectares of residential land . however , as at yesterday , 16 hectares of land has still not been auctioned . the government has deferred the auction of a considerable hectarage of residential land until the final quarter of the financial year . if the residential sites cannot be sold before the end of the financial year , some land will be wasted , and this will seriously affect the future supply of residential flats . may i ask whether the government considers such an administrative arrangement reasonable ? what measures and plans does the government have to ensure the sale of the remaining 16 hectares of land at reasonable prices in the next two months or so ? and will the government consider abandoning the high land price policy ? secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr president , to start at the back , the government does not have a high land price policy and it will therefore not consider abandoning it . i would like to thank the honourable member for his congratulations . this afternoon we sold the site at sha tin which is a residential site . the opening price was $130 million and the sale price was $171 million ; there were five bidders and 42 bids . it remains to be seen what happens to the other two lots . as regards the main part of the question , i think it is necessary to bear in mind that a proportion of the hectarage which is in the 1994-95 programme was agreed to be added to the programme only late in 1994 . it is therefore unavoidable that the sale of that hectarage will take place during the next few months . and this of course is one of the problems of the land disposal programme which is not a mechanistic rigid activity but a living breathing process , and i think that needs to be borne in mind . the other point about it is this : there is no question of the government ensuring that it sells a given hectarage ; it is the market that decides what hectarage it wishes to receive . it is the job of the government to put onto the market such land as it believes is indicated as being required . but in the final analysis , decisions on purchase are the decisions of purchasers , not the government . however , i believe that in the next few months we will see a good proportion of the land which we will be putting up bought . if , at the end of the day or at the end of this financial year , we have not achieved the full disposal of the hectarage , then there is no question of the land being wasted . the land is still there ; the land will be sold . it may be sold next year ; some of it may not be sold until the following year . but what will go into the land disposal programme for 1995-96 will depend on the state of the market , will depend on the views that we and the land commission take , and will in the final analysis depend on the attitude of purchasers to what we offer . mr lee wing - tat : mr president , i would like to follow up the honourable albert chan 's question . mr eason seems to have said that any land that remains unsold under this year 's land disposal programme would not be wasted . however , supposing that 30 hectares of land has been approved for disposal this year by the sino - british commission and that 5 hectares of land finally remains unsold , would mr eason clarify whether it is true that the remaining 5 hecatres of land would not be included in the 1995-96 programme of land disposal ? my main question is : the implementation of the recommendation of the report of the land production task force published in june 1994 has given rise to the increase in land disposal this year . now that the property market has slacken recently , i would like to ask mr eason : will the government continue to carry out the land disposal programmes of the next few years on the basis of the recommendation of the report of june 1994 ? president : two questions there , secretary . secretary for planning , environment and lands : at least two , mr president . i think i have to revert to the point , mr president , which i made in answering the previous supplementary . we have not yet devised a formula whereby we have been able to compel purchasers to buy everything we put up for sale , and in hong kong , it is unlikely that we would ever reach such a glorious state . it is our intention , and i think this has been indicated by the adjustment that was made to the land disposal programme 1994-95 , to implement the recommendations of the task force to achieve the additional supply of flats . we should seek to achieve the recommendation which was agreed in 1994 . and the question as to whether hectarage which cannot be disposed of in the 1994- 95 financial year will be included in the 1995-96 programme will depend very much on our assessment of the market position in the coming few months and how we view the prospects for land sales during 1995-96 . and of course , it will also rest to a considerable degree on discussions and the agreement which it is necessary to achieve in the land commission . but we will certainly be seeking to continue to implement the recommendations of the task force . mr henry tang :: mr president , how will the government estimate or assess the impact on this year 's budget caused by reduced land sale proceeds and the sluggish stock and property markets ? will the government increase profits tax and salaries tax or reduce various kinds of public expenditure as a means of maintaining treasury revenue ? president : how does that question elucidate anything that has already been said in the main answer , mr tang ? ( laughter ) mr henry tang : mr president , actually , the main answer says that there is a very minute shortfall regarding the sale of land and i know that revenue from the sale of land is a major revenue for the budget , so therefore the revenue would have serious implications for other parts of the budget . president : i am ruling that question out of order , mr tang . do you want another one ? mr henry tang : mr president , may i rephrase the question then ? president : yes . mr henry tang : mr president , as far as i am aware , recently many people are not too optimistic about the sale of land because the " reserve price " , that is the minimum price , is higher than the market price . may i ask whether the government will review again the " reserve price " in the light of current market prices ? secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr president , we will certainly continue to review the land disposal programme . we have a full programme in the next few months . we have , incidentally , sold a second lot this afternoon , an industrial lot at ap lei chau for $230 million . so we will continue to review the state of the land disposal programme and our success in selling lots that we put up and of course we will be reviewing the revenue implications . aircraft noise nuisance 5 . dr yeung sum asked : residents of kowloon city , sham shui po , wong tai sin , kwun tong and hong kong east have long endured serious aircraft noise nuisance . however , the civil aviation department has proposed to increase the number of programmed aircraft movements in the early morning hours and extend the programming hours at kai tak to 12.30 a.m. in connection with this , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the reasons for aggravating the problem of aircraft noise nuisance on the grounds of economic benefits at a time when there is a steady growth in the territory 's economy ; ( b ) whether the government will proceed with the implementation of the proposal of extending the programming hours at kai tak in the face of the objections from many residents living in the affected areas ; and ( c ) whether the government has made any assessment of the possible economic loss arising from the decline in the quality of life standard and productivity of residents who suffering from the noise nuisance ? secretary for economic services : mr president , the hong kong international airport at kai tak is now operating at close to capacity . in 1994 , the airport handled a total throughput of over 25 million passengers and almost 1.3 million tonnes of air cargo . air traffic demand continues to increase , yet there are virtually no usable runway slots available to satisfy new demand . in the current winter scheduling season , the civil aviation department has had to turn down some 300 flights per week , at considerable cost to business , the tourism industry and the hong kong economy as a whole . in the light of the increasing pressure on kai tak and the cost to the economy of turning away so many flights , we believe it is prudent to consider whether further measures should be taken to increase kai tak 's operating capacity . unfortunately , the options available are limited and rely heavily on fitting in more aircraft movements at those times of the day when there is still runway capacity available , namely early in the morning and late in the evening . we do recognize that any proposals to increase the number of programmed aircraft movements will , if implemented , cause a degree of additional noise nuisance to those living in the vicinity of the airport . the administration fully accepts that the potential economic benefits of increasing capacity at kai tak must be weighed carefully against the environmental implications and the impact on the quality of life of those residents affected by aircraft noise . as members will be aware , the administration has recently embarked on a comprehensive public consultation exercise to assess the reaction of the community to the various options for increasing kai tak capacity . particular emphasis is being placed on obtaining the views of residents in those districts most directly affected by aircraft noise , as well as the views of the travel and tourism industries and the business sector . i would like to assure honourable members that the administration is approaching this consultation exercise with an entirely open mind . our priority , at this stage , is to listen carefully to the views expressed by various sectors of the community , including members of this council , before considering whether the options put forward should be implemented . dr yeung sum : mr president , i am glad to hear from the government that there is no pre-determined outcome for this consultation . can the government inform this council what assessment the environmental protection department ( epd ) has made in regard to the noise implications of the proposals in question ? what is the government 's attitude towards this assessment ? secretary for economic services : mr president , the epd has made a very careful and detailed assessment of the noise implications based on information provided by the civil aviation department in terms of the profile of landings and take - offs at various times of the day , and the impact that the noise from those landings and take - offs will have on different parts of the territory . as i am sure the honourable member will appreciate , the process by which they calculate the actual number of decibels that will be yielded during landings and take - offs is a very complicated one . i would be happy to ask my colleagues in the epd to provide further details on how they do this , in writing , if that would be acceptable . dr yeung sum : mr president , my question is in fact quite simple . just now , i asked what the government 's response to the epd 's noise assessment was . in other words , can the government inform this council whether the epd finds the noise from aircraft movements in the small hours acceptable ? secretary for economic services : mr president , the assessment of the epd has been set out very clearly in the consultation document that has been issued to district board members and to others . as we have stressed all along , we are undertaking a full , frank and honest consultation on this subject and the views of the epd have been set out very clearly , i think , and in words which the layman can understand . the position is that people living in the vicinity of the airport are already exposed to varying degrees of noise nuisance . quite clearly , any additional aircraft movements will serve to increase to a certain extent the degree of nuisance that those people are experiencing . and that has , i think , in numerical terms , been set out clearly in the consultation document . dr yeung sum : mr president , i believe you would also feel that the government has not answered my question directly . my question is : does the epd , as a department with the relevant professional expertise , find the government 's proposals acceptable in terms of noise implications ? my question is that simple ; yet , it seems that the government has failed to answer whether the noises can be accepted . secretary for economic services : i am sorry , mr president , i may be misunderstanding the question but it is not wilfully so . in the consultation document , we have attempted to set out clearly the facts both in terms of the economic benefits that are being lost as a result of congestion at kai tak and also the impact in terms of noise nuisance that will be caused by additional flights . those facts have been set out clearly in the document on the basis of which we want to listen to the views of the people who will be affected , so i think now is not the time to make judgments on the various assessments . those assessments are intended to form a basis for soliciting views on the proposals . mr martin lee : mr president , as far as the issue under discussion is concerned , can the government inform this council how it ranks the relative importance of economic benefits and the quality of life of the people ? which is more important , economic benefits or the quality of life of the people ? secretary for economic services : mr president , i think that is a judgment that is probably not proper for the administration to make in isolation . that is why we are seeking the views of the community on what is a very important issue . we have set out for the community in the consultation document the pros and cons of not proceeding with further measures to maximize the capacity of kai tak . we have tried to explain those in terms of the economic cost that will be incurred . so it is not a question of making a judgment between making money and the environmental implications of that . at present , what we are doing is seeking views from the community on what is a very difficult judgment to make , just a few years before the problem will be solved completely when we close down kai tak and move to the new airport . mr martin barrow : mr president , it will not surprise the secretary that i support an increase in aircraft movements and i hope it is appreciated that we will not recover in future years any economic disbenefit over the next three years . would the secretary inform this council whether the government is emphasizing that any additional noise is for a limited finite period only and that those who may be affected should be encouraged to think of their millions of fellow citizens who will benefit in many ways through maximizing economic growth for the community as a whole ? secretary for economic services : mr president , as i just said , we have drawn attention during the consultation process to the fact that the additional noise nuisance will be for a finite period . people living in the vicinity of the airport are already experiencing considerable noise nuisance . that is well understood . what is being asked of them is whether they can tolerate a little bit more nuisance for a further short period of years before the opening of the new airport . mrs elsie tu : mr president , may i ask the secretary what abatement measures are being taken , if any , to minimize the nuisance , especially for the residents who are living directly in the flight - path of the aircraft ? secretary for economic services : mr president , we have recently introduced a number of additional mitigating measures to reduce noise nuisance to residents . in particular , with effect from october 1994 , airlines are no longer permitted to schedule arrivals after 10.30 pm . secondly , all aircrafts programmed to operate after 9.00 pm now have to comply with more stringent noise standards laid down by the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) in chapter 3 of annex 16 of the chicago convention which relates to environmental standards . as a further measure , with effect from 10 november 1994 , the adoption of icao approved noise abatement take - off procedures has been made mandatory in respect of all aircraft departing the hong kong international airport . dr conrad lam : mr president , in her reply , the secretary for economic services repeatedly mentioned economic benefits . as a medical doctor practising in the vicinity of the airport , i can tell you that some residents have actually come to me because of loss of sleep due to aircraft noises . while looking at economic benefits , has the government ever considered that it should compensate those who need to seek medical help because of sleeplessness caused by noise nuisance ? if not , will it consider doing so ? secretary for economic services : mr president , i think we are very , very conscious of the nuisance that is caused to residents now , and of the cost in terms of loss of sleep that they face . that is a situation that already exists . the problem we face is that it will not be possible to bring that situation to an end for another few years before the opening of the new airport . so as i say , we are very , very conscious of that problem but in essence , the proposals in the consultation paper are asking residents in those areas whether they can tolerate a little more nuisance for a further limited period of time . rev fung chi - wood : mr president , the government has proposed to allow more flights because it is afraid that doing otherwise would affect our tourist industry and economy . so the responsibility is placed on the shoulders of the residents living under the flight - path . in fact , the government , to a certain extent , is also to blame because of its delay in the construction of the new airport . under the noise control ordinance , noise at night should not exceed 65 decibels , but residents living under the flight - path have to tolerate a noise level as high as 90 to 100 decibels . since the noise problem is already very serious , and the government still wants to increase aircraft movements , will further unfairness be done to those living in kowloon city or under the flight - path ? increasing the number of flights is doubtlessly a pusuit of benefits at the expense of these people . secretary for economic services : mr president , i can only repeat that as to the fairness of these proposals , we are seeking the views of the community . we are seeking their views extensively and we will take very careful account of the views that are expressed before any final decisions are taken on these proposals . payment - by - cash trades ' tax liability 6. mr michael ho asked : at present , the transactions in some trades in the sales and services sectors in the territory are carried out mainly on a cash basis . as such transactions are not accounted for by formal receipts and a proper accounting system , the incomes earned in these sectors may not be accurately reflected in their tax returns . as a result , the government is unable to collect the correct amount of tax payable , thereby affecting public revenue and creating social inequity . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) whether the government will introduce legislation or other measures requiring trades which carry out transactions on a cash basis to maintain clear records of income and expenditure , and to put into place an accounting system which allows accounts to be traced ; and ( b ) whether consideration will be given to imposing such requirements on certain types of trades first ; if not , why not ? secretary for treasury : mr president , the government is fully committed to fighting tax evasion . over the past three years , the inland revenue department investigation and field audit staff tackled over 3 500 cases and obtained more than $2.7 billion in back tax and penalties . in last year 's budget speech , the financial secretary highlighted the problem of under - reporting of income by businesses and professions which receive cash payments for their goods and services . part of the problem stems from inadequate business records . since the last budget speech , the commissioner of inland revenue has met and written to professional bodies and trade associations to outline the need to keep proper accounts and issue proper receipts . specifically concerning the first point raised by the honourable member , our law already requires all trades , including those which carry out transactions on a payment - by - cash basis , to maintain records of their income and expenditure . the law also requires the traders to retain such records for a period of not less than seven years . such records should be sufficient to enable the commissioner to ascertain them readily for the purpose of assessing tax liabilities . we are currently considering whether and , if so , how we need to strengthen the existing provisions in the light of experience gained from field audit and investigation activities . on the second point , the requirement to maintain sufficient records applies to every person carrying on a trade , profession or business in hong kong . we do not think it would be appropriate or helpful at this stage to single out particular professions or trades for more stringent requirements . mr michael ho : mr president , in paragraph 3 of the answer it is said that at present our law already requires such records to be maintained and that the records should be adequate to enable the commissioner of inland revenue to assess tax liabilities . however , the plain fact is that tax evasion is extremely serious in the retail trades and other trades that involve payment - by - cash transactions . so , where does the problem lie ? is it because some people do not obey the law , making it impossible to eradicate the problem ? or are there loopholes in the law itself ? what does the government think ? secretary for the treasury : mr president , the existing system is not perfect , and we find tax evasion in that area . therefore , we need to review the situation . as i said in my answer , we are currently conducting a review which covers a wide variety of areas including the adequacy of the law , existing manpower and procedures . in other words , the points raised by the honourable member just now are all included in our review . dr leong che - hung : thank you , mr president . in the last paragraph of the main answer , the secretary mentioned that the government does not thinks it would be appropriate or helpful to single out particular professions or trades for more stringent requirements . could the administration inform this council if the government considers it appropriate and helpful to single out particular professions and trades for more stringent investigations , and if so , which professions and trades , and why ? secretary for the treasury : as i said in my answer , mr president , we do not wish to generalize and i think it would be unfair to condemn any profession generally . it all depends upon the conduct of individual taxpayers . the emphases of our investigation are guided by the experience of the field audit teams , by the cases they have in hand . sometimes they will concentrate on certain professions and other times on other professions . president : yes , dr leong , not answered ? dr leong che - hung : thank you , mr president . can the secretary therefore confirm that no single trade or profession is singled out for specific investigations ? secretary for the treasury : the commissioner is tackling all professions . dr huang chen - ya : mr president , the secretary mentioned in his reply that trades that carry out transactions on a payment - by - cash basis are required to maintain records of their income and expenditure . but how can the government ascertain these records are accurate and reliable ? would the secretary please elaborate with examples from different trades ? secretary for the treasury : not all trades issue receipts . the law does require them to retain reasonable records of their income and expenditure . however , the law does not stipulate that they must issue receipts . of course , if receipts are issued , it will be easier to identify tax evaders . mr fred li : mr president , according to the secretary , there will be a review and the law will also be improved . will the administration study the experience of other countries such as our neightbour , taiwan ? taiwan adopts a very interesting approach to this problem . there , customers can exchange the receipts they are issued for lucky draw coupons . this can encourage people to ask for receipts in the course of transactions , thus reducing the chance of tax evasion . so , will the secretary consider this method ? secretary for the treasury : mr president , i have also heard about this , and we have collected information on this . mr man sai - cheong : mr president , according to the government 's record or estimate , what is the amount of the government 's annual revenue loss as a result of the retail industry 's confusing accounting system and how serious is the problem ? apart from the field auditing system , has the government considered other means to solve the problem ? secretary for the treasury : i have already mentioned the gravity of the issue in my reply . last year , we investigated a total of 3 500 cases and obtained more than $2.7 billion in back tax and penalties . this is a sizeable sum which indicates that the problem is rather serious . regarding the steps we are going to take , i want to point out that this is one of the area under review . we will definitely study what measures can be taken to improve the existing procedures and legislation . president : not answered , mr man ? mr man sai - cheong : what measures have been considered by the administration ? i am not asking about any decision . will the secretary share with us the measures under consideration ? secretary for the treasury : what we are considering includes our legislation , our manpower resources and our existing operating procedures and other related issues . mr peter wong : mr president , in the second paragraph of the secretary 's answer , he said the commissioner of inland revenue has met and written to professional bodies and trade associations . has there been any positive response from those bodies and whether they are going to carry out any enforcement action amongst their members in order to make sure that their members comply with proper accounting procedures ? secretary for the treasury : yes indeed , mr president , we have received both positive and negative responses from professional bodies . we have taken their comments into account and all these will be reflected in our review and we will be able to , i hope , in the light of this review , introduce further measures . mr marvin cheung : mr president , could the secretary please elaborate on the answers given in the third paragraph about the legal requirement for the maintenance of books and records ? precisely what are the specific requirements , where are the requirements contained in the particular ordinances ; and what provisions are there to ensure that the records maintained are accurate and complete ? secretary for the treasury : the law , mr president , at present does not specify what the proper records for tax purposes are . well , common sense dictates that the records should enable all business transactions to be traced , explained and verified through the accounting system . we leave it very much to the judgment of the commissioner of inland revenue . and also , the specific types of records to be kept depend very much on the type of business involved . generally , they should be expected to include invoices for goods sold and purchased , receipts for money received , invoices and receipts for items of business expenditure , cash books , ledgers and stock records . mr michael ho : mr president , i would like to ask one more follow - up question on the reply by the secretary . he said that a rather extensive review of the legislation , manpower and operating procedures is under way . but then , nearly a year has passed since the financial secretary last talked about combatting tax evasion . so can the administration tell us what the progress of the review in the past year has been ? and when the review is expected to complete ? secretary for the treasury : over the past year , we have in fact actively conducted this review . the commissioner of inland revenue , myself and my colleagues in the finance branch have made regular reports to the relevant panels of this council . in the past year , we have considered what strategies should be adopted and have carried out specific surveys . we have also consulted relevant bodies and organizations on their views and we hope to be able to come up with specific recommendations in the near future . written answers to questions three - tier system of authorized financial institutions 7. mr roger luk asked : in view of the recent deregulation of hong kong dollar time deposit rates by the hong kong association of banks , will the administration inform this council when a review of the existing three - tier system of authorized institutions will be carried out ? secretary for financial services : mr president , the administration continues to believe that the three - tier structure of authorized institutions has its value , and does not consider that the partial relaxation of the interest rate rules ( irr ) of the hong kong association of banks , in itself , creates an immediate need to review or change the three - tier structure . the three - tier structure enables account to be taken of the diverse characteristics of those institutions which are authorized to take deposits from the public , and provides flexibility for entry into the hong kong banking sector , particularly for foreign banks . it also enables a wide range of institutions to be authorized while restricting access to retail deposits , thus avoiding the potential destabilizing effects of excessive competition in this area . the restriction placed on the ability to take retail deposits was seen in the past as a means for reinforcing the irr . however , it follows from the previous paragraph that this is not the only rationale for the three - tier structure . this is not to say that a review should not be conducted in due course . however , it would be premature to do so at this stage since the full effects of the deregulation of interest rates on time deposits on the three types of authorized institutions have yet to be seen . investigation of listed companies 8. mr chim pui - chung asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council of the number of listed companies investigated by the securities and futures commission last year under section 33 of the securities and futures commission ordinance ( chapter 24 ) , and the number of such companies which have been formally prosecuted or convicted ? secretary for financial services : mr president , section 33 of the securities and futures commission ordinance ( sfco ) does not empower the securities and futures commission ( sfc ) to investigate the conduct of listed companies . the only power available to the sfc to investigate the conduct of listed companies is section 29a of the sfco . section 29a provides a limited power of inspection of books and records if grounds set out therein exist . since the enactment of section 29a in july 1994 , the sfc has commenced three investigations . two of the investigations resulted in high court proceedings which are pending before the court . the one remaining investigation is ongoing . section 33 of the sfco , however , does enable the sfc to investigate suspicious dealings by persons in the shares of listed companies . such investigations may be commenced where contraventions of various ordinances and codes are suspected , for example , the securities ( insider dealing ) ordinance , the securities ( disclosure of interests ) ordinance , the code on takeovers and mergers and certain of the stock exchange 's listing rules . a total of 31 such investigations were commenced during 1994 . of these , five have been finalized , with two of them resulting in prosecutions and convictions and one resulting in administrative action by the sfc . the remaining investigations are still ongoing . imported workers at chek lap kok 9. dr conrad lam asked ( in chinese ) : it is learnt that imported workers at the chek lap kok airport construction sites receive harsh treatment at work , such as excessively long working hours and unreasonably low wages etc. ( a ) of the number of complaints lodged with the labour department by these workers against their employers over the past three years ; together with a breakdown of the main categories of complaints and their respective percentages ; and ( b ) whether the government will consider adopting measures to safeguard the labour rights of these workers ? secretary for education and manpower : mr president , ( a ) over the past three years , the labour department has received a total of eight complaint cases from imported workers working on construction sites of the airport core programme ( acp ) projects . each of these cases comprised a variety of complaint items involving a different number of imported workers . the main categories of complaint and their respective percentages are as follows : categories of complaints percentage of total non-granting of statutory holidays 16% and rest days underpayment of basic wages 16% unlawful wage deduction 16% long working hours 5% others ( such as deployment to 26% other posts and failure to arrange payment of wages by autopay ) ( b ) under the special importation of labour scheme for acp projects , workers imported are employed under a standard employment contract for the duration of the particular works contract provided that it does not exceed two years . this employment contract is governed by all labour laws applicable to local workers in hong kong . employers who breach the conditions stipulated under the standard employment contract are liable to be prosecuted under the relevant legislation . furthermore , if they have acted against other conditions under the scheme , approval may not be granted for replacement workers to be brought in , and their future applications for quotas under the scheme may be refused . such control mechanism has been in force since the scheme began to operate in 1991 . the labour department has one special enforcement team tasked with the responsibility of conducting regular inspections at both the accommodation and employment areas of imported workers for acp projects . if any offences are detected and they are backed up by sufficient evidence , prosecution actions will be taken against the individuals involved . two more enforcement teams will be added , one in each of the coming two financial years . to ensure that imported workers are aware of their rights , the department organizes regular briefing sessions for imported workers to inform them of their rights under the standard employment contracts governing their employment in hong kong . the department also operates a 24 - hour complaint hotline specifically for them . use of unleaded petrol in public buses 10. mr henry tang asked ( in chinese ) : it is learnt that the government is considering requiring all diesel engined vehicles with an axle weight of under four tons to switch to using unleaded petrol ( ulp ) as fuel in 1996 so as to reduce air pollution . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the extent of air pollution in the urban area caused by exhaust gas emitted by diesel - powered public buses ; ( b ) whether consideration has been given to the introduction of measures requiring public buses to use ulp at a later stage ; if so , what such measures are and when they will be implemented ; and whether any measures will be adopted to minimize air pollution by public buses during the transition period ; if not , why not ; ( c ) whether the government will require bus companies to purchase new vehicles using ulp ; if not , why not ; and ( d ) whether any study has been made to ascertain the rate of increase in operating costs of the bus companies after the switch to ulp as well as its effect on bus fares ; if so , what the details are ? secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr president , ( a ) diesel - powered public buses contribute about 17% of respirable suspended particulates , the major air pollutant in the urban areas , and small diesel vehicles contribute about 60% of this pollutant . ( b ) as most public buses are larger than four tonnes in gross vehicle weight , and are powered by diesel engines because there is currently no viable petrol alternative for them , the government has no plans at present to require such vehicles to use unleaded petrol . however , like all other diesel vehicles , starting from 1 april 1995 , diesel - powered public buses will be required to use cleaner diesel ( with sulphur content below 0.2% ) and all newly registered large diesel vehicles , including new public buses , will be required to comply with stringent emission standards similar to those currently adopted in europe . ( c ) the government has no plans to require bus companies to purchase buses using unleaded petrol because no such buses are available on the market . ( d ) for the reasons stated above , it is not possible to provide substantive data for cost comparison . the feasibility of requiring diesel - engined vehicles under four tonnes to switch to unleaded petrol is still being examined by the government . rehousing clearees in estate block 11. mr frederick fung asked ( in chinese ) : the housing authority has recently decided to reserve block 12 of kwai shing east estate for rehousing squatter clearees who are eligible for rehousing in temporary housing areas . in this connection , will the government inform this council whether : ( a ) the eligibility criteria for rehousing in this block are identical to those for allocation of public rental flats ; ( b ) any squatters who meet the rehousing eligibility criteria , irrespective of whether they are affected by any clearance operation , will be allocated flats in this block ; if so , what are the criteria for determining the priority for allocation of flats ; ( c ) residents rehoused in this block can apply for transfer to larger flats in future on the ground of overcrowding ; and ( d ) a date has been fixed for clearing block 12 of kwai east estate ; if so , when it will be cleared ; and in case of clearance , whether residents of this block will enjoy the same rights as those clearees of redevelopment areas , or be classified as a new category of clearees ? secretary for housing : mr president , block 12 of kwai shing east estate , which will become available in june this year , has been reserved for rehousing squatter clearees in tsuen wan and kwai chung districts who fail to meet the eligibility criteria for rehousing in public rental housing flats , that is those who are only eligible for rehousing in temporary housing areas ( thas ) in the new territories . this special arrangement has been made in view of the shortage of tha spaces to meet the demand arising from squatter clearances in these two districts and the governor 's pledge to clear , by 1996 , all thas built before 1984 . the status of squatter clearees to be rehoused in this block is similar to that of tha residents . they will not be given the same treatment as public rental housing tenants in respect of overcrowding relief or upon redevelopment of the block for which no timetable has been fixed . overloading of green minibuses 12. mr wong wai - yin asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council : ( a ) whether it is aware of the overloading problem of green minibuses operating in some round - the - clock service routes or in rural areas ; if so , what are the causes of overloading ; and ( b ) how the authority concerned will monitor and improve the overloading problem described above ? secretary for transport : mr president , overloading of green minibuses is not a widespread problem . in 1994 , the transport department and the transport complaints unit received only 27 such complaints , of which three were related to all - night or rural services . the transport department monitors the operation of green minubuses closely . complaints about overloading are carefully and thoroughly investigated . operators are required to conduct their own investigations into these complaints , provide explanations , and rectify the situation where the complaints are substantiated . the commissioner for transport has powers to suspend or revoke the licence of the operator if the latter fails to rectify the problem to his satisfaction . in 1994 , 10 written and four verbal warnings were given but no licence was suspended or revoked because of overloading offences . as overloading of green minibuses constitutes a traffic offence , referrals are also made to the police for investigation and enforcement action . when there is increased passenger demand for a particular route , arrangements will be made by the commissioner for transport to increase service capacity . burglaries in schools 13. mr cheung man - kwong ( in chinese ) : in regard to burglaries in schools , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the breakdown by district of the number of such cases in each of the past three years , together with the particulars of the stolen items and the estimated value in each case as well as the number of cases which have been solved ; ( b ) whether the education department ( ed ) will ask schools to take out insurance on the relatively expensive items such as audio - visual equipment and computers ; and whether the ed has provided funds for schools to replace the lost items in case of thefts ; if so , the total amount of funds allocated in the past three years ; and ( c ) whether the ed has adopted any measures to help schools to improve their security systems , such as installing anti-theft devices in classrooms or rooms where the relatively expensive items are stored , so as to reduce the chances of thefts occurring ? secretary for education and manpower : mr president , the number of burglary cases in schools reported to the education department ( ed ) was 28 for the school year 1992-93 , 33 for 1993-94 and 17 for the period from september to november 1994 . the items stolen ranged from petty cash , tools and cupboards to audio - visual aids and office equipment such as fax machines and computers . details are at the appendix . we do not keep record on the original value of these stolen items and on the number of cases solved by the police , though each case of burglary must be reported to the police before compensation may be claimed from the ed for replacement purpose . for the amount of compensation , please refer to the appendix . ( a ) the government acts as an insurer of all standard items which include specified audio - visual equipment and computers in all the government and aided schools . stolen items are therefore replaced as a matter of policy by the ed . for above - standard and non-standard items , schools have been advised to take out insurance by themselves . ( b ) the total amount of funds approved for the replacement of stolen standard items since the 1992-93 school year is shown at the appendix . ( c ) the ed has advised all schools to strengthen their security . schools may also apply to the ed for funds to install anti-theft measures such as window bars and iron gates . appendix record of burglary cases reported to ed southern (3) typewriter ) western (2) western (1) ) wan chai (1) ) health of new - born babies 14. dr huang chen - ya asked ( in chinese ) : as there are now methods to prevent the transmission of hepatitis b and aids by pregnant women to their babies , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the total number of pregnant women admitted to public hospitals who have been carriers of hepatitis b or aids virus over the past three years ; and ( b ) what measures are being taken by the hospital authority to prevent babies from being infected with hepatitis b and aids virus , thus ensuring the health of babies ? secretary for health and welfare : mr president , ( a ) based on epidemiological studies , the overall prevalence rate of hepatitis b carriers among the population in hong kong is about 10%. since there have been slightly over 45 000 deliveries annually in public hospitals in recent years , it is estimated that approximately 14 000 pregnant women in public hospitals over the past three years would have been carriers of hepatitis b . the prevalence rate of hiv infection among pregnant women in hong kong is very low . epidemiological surveys among newly born infants in hong kong have not detected any unknown hiv carriers to date . there is in fact only one documented case of transmission of aids by a pregnant woman to her baby . ( b ) pregnant mothers are routinely screened for hepatitis b during the antenatal period . if discovered to be a carrier , the mother will be given health advice and counselling to minimize the risk of transmission of hepatitis b to their babies . all babies born in public hospitals to mothers carrying the virus will be vaccinated with the hepatitis b vaccine and given a dose of hepatitis b immunoglobulin at birth . in addition , the recommended hepatitis b vaccination programme would ensure that all new - born babies in hong kong are given hepatitis b vaccines as part of the universal immunization programme . hiv infected patients are given advice and counselling , including the risk of transmission of aids to their babies . should women who are hiv positive become pregnant , specific counselling would also be given . the risk of transmission to the baby would be explained and the pregnant woman would be given the choice as to whether to allow the pregnancy to continue . appropriate drugs which are known to reduce the rate of vertical transmission from mother to baby may be prescribed for pregnant women who are carriers of hiv , provided that they fully understand the benefits and risks involved and have given their consent . the health of the babies born to these mothers will be ensured by regular check - ups . performance assessment of lecturers 15 . miss emily lau asked ( in chinese ) : it is learnt that a performance appraisal system for lecturers on contract terms has been established in tertiary institutions funded by the university grants committee ( ugc ) . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) what methods are used by these institutions to assess the performance of lecturers on pensionable terms ; and whether a performance appraisal system identical or similar to that for lecturers on contract terms has been adopted by these institutions ; and ( b ) whether these institutions will consider demoting lecturers whose performance does not meet the required standard ? secretary for education and manpower : mr president , ( a ) the administration understands that with the exception of the lingnan college where no academic staff are employed on pensionable terms , all the ugc - funded institutions have established staff appraisal systems for their academic staff employed on superannuable ( pensionable ) terms . the methods for assessing the performance of lecturers on superannuable terms vary amongst institutions because of their historical backgrounds and management practices . in short , they in general involve a review of performance in teaching , research and professional and public service . in the case of the city university of hong kong , the hong kong polytechnic university and the hong kong baptist university , the performance appraisal systems for academic staff employed on superannuable terms are identical to those for academic staff employed on fixed - term contracts . for the lingnan college , all staff are employed on fixed - term contracts , hence a single appraisal system is adopted . the chinese university of hong kong and the hong kong university of science and technology do not have an appraisal system for academic staff employed on fixed - term contracts , but they do have an established review system for considering reappointment of contract staff . the university of hong kong does not have a formal procedure for reviewing performance of staff on fixed - term contracts but such procedures are being developed . ( b ) the administration understands that the ugc - funded institutions all adopt similar practices in dealing with academic staff with substandard performance . for those staff on contract terms whose performance is substandard , they will be encouraged and assisted to improve their performance . failing that , their contracts will not be renewed upon expiry . for those on superannuable terms , the institutions may withhold their annual salary increment or extend the non-substantiated period for the staff concerned . to date no academic staff have been downgraded because of substandard performance . importation of chinese domestic helpers 16. mrs peggy lam asked ( in chinese ) : recently survey results indicate that there is a shortfall of 30 000 domestic helpers in the territory , particularly chinese maids . this has led to the abuse by many employers of the importation of semi - skilled labour scheme in order to import chinese domestic helpers . in view of this , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the number of prosecutions regarding the abuse of the importation of semi - skilled labour scheme by importing chinese maids in the past three years ; ( b ) what measures does the government have to curb the problem of abusing the importation of semi - skilled labour scheme ; and ( c ) whether the government will consider permitting the importation of chinese domestic helpers ? secretary for education and manpower : mr president , we have no statistics which indicate that there is a shortfall of domestic helpers or that the shortage is of a particular nationality or ethnicity in hong kong . the demand for domestic helpers can be met by local supply and the importation of foreign domestic helpers , which is subject to normal immigration control but no quota ceiling . on the other hand , under the general importation of labour scheme , all the imported workers are to be employed under a standard employment contract for a period of not more than two years . such imported workers are not allowed to change jobs during their stay in hong kong . there are no indications that employers under this scheme have abused it to hire domestic helpers from china . my reply to the three specific parts of the question is as follows : ( a ) the immigration department has not received any complaints of such abuse . no imported workers have been prosecuted for taking up unauthorized employment as domestic helpers . neither have any employers been prosecuted for deploying imported workers to jobs other than those stipulated in their employment contracts under the general importation of labour scheme . ( b ) to ensure that imported workers are employed in accordance with the terms of employment under their employment contracts , four special teams of labour inspectors of the labour department pay regular inspections to places of employment of imported workers . prosecutions will be taken against employers who have breached the terms of the employment contracts , according to the relevant labour legislation . other irregularities concerning breach of conditions under the scheme , which are detected during inspections , will also be referred to the immigration department for further action . the immigration department conducts regular raids , including joint operations with the police , at such places of employment to see whether there are breaches of conditions under the general scheme , such as whether the imported workers have taken up jobs different from those specified in their employment contracts . any imported workers engaged in unauthorized work are liable on conviction to a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for two years . they will also be liable to removal from hong kong . likewise , any employers who are prosecuted for deploying their imported workers illegally are liable to the same penalty , although the liability to removal from hong kong will not apply to them . moreover , they may have their quotas withdrawn and be debarred from participation in the scheme in future as their adverse record will be taken into account when considering any new applications for importation from them . ( c ) foreign domestic helpers have been allowed to work in hong kong for over two decades to meet a specific demand in hong kong . we have been making regular improvements to the scheme to cope with the needs of our community , and the arrangements have been working well . since the importation of domestic helpers from china will pose an immigration problem , we do not consider that it is in our best interest to allow such domestic helpers to enter hong kong for employment . making use of cssa payments for drug abuse 17. dr lam kui - chun asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council whether : ( a ) any estimate has been made of the number of drug abusers among the current recipients of payments under the comprehensive social security assistance scheme ; and ( b ) there are any measures to prevent the use of the maintenance grants under the scheme for drug abuse ? secretary for health and welfare : mr president , ( a ) no estimate has been made of the number of drug abusers receiving financial assistance under the comprehensive social security assistance ( cssa ) scheme . ( b ) measures are taken to ensure that recipients of cssa payments understand the purpose of the payments , namely , to assist in meeting basic needs such as food , clothing and accommodation . but no general control is exercised over the way in which cssa payment is actually spent and there are therefore no specific controls to prevent the use of cssa grants for drug abuse . it would not be operationally possible to exercise such control , although controls exist to ensure claimants genuinely meet eligibility criteria and comply with all the current safeguards in the system to prevent abuse ( for example , able - bodied adult recipients are required actively to seek employment ) . rehousing of urban squatters 18. mr fred li asked ( in chinese ) : it was mentioned in the 1994 policy address that all urban squatters on government land would be rehoused by march 1996 . however , there are some squatter areas such as lei yue mun village and cha kwo ling village which are situated on both government and private lands . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) whether the government has any plan to resume such squatter areas for public purposes ; if so , whether there is a specific timetable to clear such squatter areas and how the squatters will be rehoused ; ( b ) whether , in regard to those squatter areas where there is no plan to resume private land for public purposes , the government will clear the squatter huts on government land only and rehouse those squatters who are affected by the clearance ; ( c ) if the answer to ( b ) is in the affirmative , how the government will deal with the squatters on private land in the same squatter area who will not be cleared and rehoused ; and ( d ) if the answer to ( b ) is in the negative , whether the government has other policies to deal with such squatter areas , and how it will fulfill its pledge to rehouse all urban squatters on government land by 1996 ? secretary for housing : mr president , ( a ) there are 22 squatter areas in the territory situated on mixed government and private land . the clearance of these areas will not proceed until the private lots have been resumed for public purposes . there is no timetable for such clearance at present . ( b ) the administration will not consider partial clearance of these squatter areas in view of the likely problems of environment , security and disruption which may be caused to the remaining residents . ( c ) the administration is making steady progress in fulfilling the governor 's undertaking to clear all urban squatters on government land by march 1996 . squatter areas situated on mixed government and private land do not fall within the governor 's undertaking , and their clearance will only be carried out when the private lots are resumed for public purposes . local property prices 19. mr eric li asked ( in chinese ) : the secretary for planning , environment and lands recently mentioned that local property prices might further fall by 5% to 10%, and he expected that the gap between property prices and the affordability of the public would be narrowed within this year . will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the grounds , research or survey data on which the above - mentioned extent of fall in property prices is based ; ( b ) the objective criteria adopted by the government to measure the property purchasing power of the public ; and what are the actual figures of the public 's affordability arrived at by the government ; and ( c ) the relevant legislation or known established policy which requires the government to provide property price indices to the public and play a direct role in determining the property price level in place of the free market mechanism ? secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr president , ( a ) the statements referred to in this question were made spontaneously in response to oral questions from the media . they were not therefore intended to be precisely analytical but were based on my interpretation at the time of various information , including past property price movements , supply indications , the activities of sellers and signs of continuing consumer resistance to prices being asked . they were also made against the background of signs that , on the one hand , over - pessimistic statements were being made about the property market , while , on the other , others were seeking to " talk the market up " . in other words , the statements were intended to strike a balance among other views being publicly expressed . ( b ) property purchasing power and affordability vary considerably from household to household and are constantly changing . they are a function of many factors , such as the income and circumstances of the individual household , aspirations as to type and price of property , interest rates , banks ' lending policies and so on . general trends are , however , discernable . ( c ) the rating and valuation department compiles price and rental indices for various classes of property as a general guide to price and rental movements . these are derived by analysing actual sales prices and rents . property price movements , however , are determined by market forces depending on demand and supply . the government 's wish is to see that the consumer or potential purchaser has as much information on price movements and supply as possible so that , with or without expert advice , he can make a considered choice . government statistics and statements are clearly only two among many sources of guidance which can be drawn upon . support to industry on environmental protection 20. mr man sai - cheong asked : the growing global trend of environmental concern is causing a major impact on the local industry , 80% of which are small and medium-sized firms . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) what measures the government has taken to assist and guide the industrial sector to comply with the local environmental legislation including the air pollution control ordinance , water pollution control ordinance , and noise control ordinance ; ( b ) what role the industry department plays in helping the local industry to become more environmentally conscious in line with the global trend ; ( c ) what specific measures the government has taken to implement the immediate action plan set out in the support to industry on environmental matters report ; and to what extent these measures have succeeded in helping the local industrialists ; and ( d ) what plan the government will make to support the local industry on environmental matters in order to enable the local industry to maintain its competitive position in the region ? secretary for trade and industry : mr president , the government aims to help small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises ( smes ) to cope with the impact of environmental controls in two ways : by increasing awareness of the benefits to manufacturers of good environmental practice in general , and how pollution control legislation may affect them in particular ; and by ensuring the provision of adequate technical services . the industry department is responsible for co-ordinating these efforts . as regards increasing awareness , the department produces a free annual guide on legislation and sources of technical help . it also provides information on environmental requirements for product standards in our major markets . in accordance with the immediate action plan , the department has commissioned the hong kong productivity council ( hkpc ) to organize seminars for industrialists and the centre for environmental technology to operate a hotline to answer queries from manufacturers , and to produce a directory of pollution control equipment and services . the hotline has been operational since october 1994 ; the directory will be published in march 1995 . the hkpc has also been funded to undertake a programme of advisory visits to smes operating in the bleaching and dyeing , electroplating , and printed circuit board ( pcb ) manufacturing industries . later this year , the industry department will reinforce these efforts with an advertising campaign on television and radio , and in newspapers . the department is also ensuring that technical services are available to help manufacturers improve their environmental controls . to this end , the hong kong laboratory accreditation scheme accredits local laboratories to offer internationally - recognized environmental testing services to manufacturers . the hkpc already provides a wide range of environmental services for manufacturers , including expert advice on air , noise and effluent pollution control , waste and energy management , and waste treatment . many manufacturers take advantage of this ; in 1993-94 , the hkpc undertook 188 environmental assignments . as part of the immediate action plan , the government is supporting the expansion of the hkpc 's technical services . manuals to help with the design of less polluting production processes for bleaching and dyeing , electroplating , and pcb manufacture will be published by the hkpc in may . the hkpc will visit 200 smes in these sectors during the first year to test effluent and advise them on how to comply with the requisite environmental standards ; 25 such projects have already been completed . on advice from the industry and technology development council , the department is funding 11 projects intended to help industrialists respond to increasing environmental awareness at home and overseas . these include projects on the treatment of waste , cleaner production techniques and technologies , noise control , and eco - labelling . the council will be asked to advise on additional projects shortly . those manufacturers who take advantage of these measures should be able to respond effectively to the growing environmental pressures at home and overseas . in the short term , pollution controls will increase production costs in some industries , although the effect can be minimized by measures to reduce energy consumption and reduce wastage . in the longer term , the demand for products produced by environmentally - friendly processes is likely to increase , and manufacturers will be better equipped to compete with their counterparts in the region . the department will continue to keep track of proposed environmental legislation in hong kong , and of developments in overseas markets , and ensure that manufacturers are consulted and informed through their associations . it will also keep under review the adequacy of technical services and seek improvements where necessary . ( a ) there shall be established a fund to be called the civil service pension reserve fund ; ( b ) the fund shall be administered by the financial secretary who may delegate his power of administration to other public officers ; ( c ) there shall be credited to the fund - ( ii ) all sums received by way of interest or dividend on moneys invested under paragraph ( f ) ; ( d ) the financial secretary may expend moneys from the fund for the purpose of meeting the liabilities for payment of pensions , gratuities or other allowances under the pensions ordinance ( cap . 89 ) , the pension benefits ordinance ( cap . 99 ) or the pension benefits ( judicial officers ) ordinance ( cap . 401 ) if , at the end of any month in a financial year , he believes that the balance in the general revenue account will be in deficit at the end of that financial year , having taken into account all anticipated receipts and payments ; ( e ) the director of accounting services shall , under the authority of a funds warrant issued by the financial secretary , pay from the fund such sums as may be required to meet expenditures from the fund ; ( f ) the financial secretary in his discretion may authorize the investment in such manner as he may determine of any moneys held in the fund at any time . " he said : mr president , i move the motion standing in my name on the order paper . the resolution seeks to establish a civil service pension reserve fund under section 29 of the public finance ordinance . the fund would be used exclusively for the payment of civil service pensions in the most unlikely event that the government were unable to meet its pension commitments from general revenue . the principle purpose in establishing the fund would be to address a general concern among civil servants about the security of their pensions . to this extent it would complement the existing statutory provisions in the pensions legislation and reinforce guarantees in the joint declaration and the basic law . under the arrangement proposed , the financial secretary would administer the fund as he does other funds established under the public finance ordinance . the fund would remain part of the government 's fiscal reserves and would be placed in the exchange fund managed by the hong kong monetary authority . interest and dividends earned would accrue to the fund . subject to this council 's approval of this resolution , we shall seek the approval of the finance committee to transfer $7 billion from general revenue to the fund within the current financial year . this transfer would not lead to any increase in public expenditure insofar as it would be a transfer of funds from one account to another . it is proposed that the balance of the fund in any given year would be maintained at a minimum of one year 's estimated pension expenditure . it may therefore be necessary to top up the fund from time to time in the future . we estimate that the expenditure on civil service pensions in 1994-95 will be $5.7 billion , and that annual pension expenditure for the next 10 years will remain at around 5% of the government 's annual operating expenditure . on the basis of these estimates , topping - up of the fund would not be required for at least the next two years . the civil service central staff consultative councils support the proposal to establish the fund as soon as possible , but have asked that the initial transfer to the fund be in the order of $15 billion , failing which it should be increased to that level by june 1997 . we have considered this request carefully but have concluded that we could not justify such a large sum to the finance committee under present circumstances . in particular , the existing statutory pension provisions , the guarantees and reassurances in the basic law and the joint declaration and the sound financial position of the government , mean that it is most unlikely that the fund would ever be used . moreover , $7 billion is already a very considerable amount and should provide a clear demonstration to the civil service of the government 's commitment to meet its obligation to pay pensions . in short , the administration considers that a pension reserve fund covering a minimum of one year 's pension expenditure is appropriate . we have balanced the claims of civil servants against the interests of the community as a whole and been mindful of what the public at large and this council would accept . we believe that the size and scope of the fund proposed meets the objective of providing the civil service with an important psychological reassurance on the future security of pensions . whilst we can see no justification for any increase in the proposed scope and size of the fund , this would not preclude a future administration from so proposing if they felt that circumstances warranted it . i am most grateful for the views of the legislative council subcommittee established to study this resolution , and for the support for early establishment of the fund . i have examined further a suggestion made by the subcommittee to include in the resolution a commitment to maintain the balance of the fund at a minimum of one year 's estimated pension expenditure . however , legal advice on this point suggests that it would not be appropriate constitutionally to include such a commitment as it might imply automatic appropriation in the resolution . as agreed with the civil service staff councils during the consultation exercise , i shall be sending the councils a written confirmation on the administration 's policy commitment to maintain the fund at a minimum balance of one year 's estimated expenditure . i believe that this will stand as a very clear statement of the administration 's position on this issue , and will serve to provide valuable reassurance to civil servants . mr president , i beg to move . question on the motion proposed . mr jimmy mcgregor : mr president , in the absence of the honourable steven poon today , i rise to speak on the resolution under section 29 of the public finance ordinance ( cap . 2 ) relating to the establishment of the civil service pension fund , as moved by the secretary for the civil service . i must also declare my interest as a recipient of a tiny but very welcome government pension . the motion seeks to establish a fund to which moneys may be appropriated for future payment of civil service pensions when the financial secretary believes that there will not be enough funds in the general revenue account to meet anticipated payments . a legislative council subcommittee with seven members was formed to study the motion . the subcommittee met the administration once to clarify some issues . i wish to take this opportunity to thank the administration for its co-operation in this matter . the subcommittee supports the establishment of the fund . some members , however , pointed out that there is no written provision in the resolution to the effect that there will always remain in the fund a sum of money not lower than the estimated pension payment of any given year . in response , the administration has said that it will not be appropriate from the constitutional point of view to include a commitment which may imply an automatic appropriation in the resolution . nevertheless , in order to give substance to the policy intention , the administration has agreed that after the resolution is passed , it will confirm in writing the policy commitment to maintain the fund at a minimum balance of any year 's estimated pension expenditure . accordingly , the administration will not propose any amendments to the resolution . the subcommittee also notes that there is a difference in opinion between the chinese authorities , the hong kong government and civil servants about the amount of money to be put into the fund initially . the administration takes the position that the initial reserve at $7 billion is already a considerable sum of money and , in the light of the continuing sound financial position of the hong kong government , the need to use the fund is remote . there are guarantees and reassurances in the basic law and the joint declaration in respect of payment of pensions after 1997 . in spite of this difference in opinion , the administration states that in fact there is a consensus among the chinese authorities , the hong kong government and civil servants that the fund should be established . the subcommittee has been advised that the initial reserve of the fund at $7 billion will be handed over to the special administrative region government in 1997 in addition to the reserve amount of $25 billion already stated in the memorandum of understanding . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr tam yiu - chung : both the sino - british joint declaration and the basic law contain provisions which effectively guarantee pensions of civil servants . nonetheless , some civil servants are still worried about their pensions . for this reason , during its visit to beijing in july 1992 , the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong made a proposal to the director of the hong kong and macau affairs office , mr lu ping , for the establishment of a civil service pension reserve fund ( csprf ) . at that time , the chinese government responded positively and was prepared to bring the matter to the joint liaison group for discussion . however , i recall that the hong kong government held a negative view at that time . as a result of the struggle for more than a year by a number of civil service groups and due to the efforts made by various sectors , the governor at last undertook to establish the csprf in his policy address last year . finally , the administration is willing to make a start . however , there is only $7 billion in the csprf . this amount is , in our view , inadequate . this view is shared by the senior civil service council , the government employees association and other civil service groups . given the present circumstances , we think that there should be $15 billion in the csprf . first , $15 billion can cover two years ' pension expenses , thereby providing a greater assurance to civil servants . second , this $15 billion will only be shown on the accounts as an appropriation from the administration but there is a very slight chance that we would have to use this sum of money . therefore , the establishment of the csprf with this amount will in fact have limited implications on the operation of the treasury or the citizens . rather , this can give civil servants confidence and is beneficial to a smooth transition . therefore , we hope members of the executive council and the administration will reconsider the suggestions or requests made by civil service groups and civil servants and increase the amount in the csprf to $15 billion in future . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . question on the motion put and agreed to . public bus services ordinance the secretary for transport moved the following motion : " that the franchise conferring the right on the new lantao bus company ( 1973 ) limited to operate a public bus service on the routes specified in the schedule of routes ( new lantao bus company ) order 1993 ( l.n. 193 of 1993 ) and in any subsequent order made by the governor in council shall not be subject to sections 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 and 31 in part v of the public bus services ordinance . " he said : mr president , i move the resolution standing in my name on the order paper . the governor in council has granted a new franchise to the new lantao bus company ( 1973 ) limited ( nlb ) to operate a public bus service with seven routes on lantau island for two years from 1 april 1995 to 31 march 1997 . this franchise will not be subject to a profit control scheme and therefore those sections of the public bus services ordinance will no longer apply in governing the permitted return under the profit control scheme , but there is a need to retain those sections which enable the government to specify depreciation rates in respect of franchise - related assets and require the company to produce accounts and other information needed for the monitoring of their performance . the resolution before honourable members seeks to give effect to these arrangements . a special subcommittee of this council comprising the honourable lee wing - tat , the honourable albert chan and the honourable andrew wong met on 17 january to examine this resolution . i understand that this subcommittee has given its support . mr president , with these remarks , i move the resolution . question on the motion proposed . mr lee wing - tat : mr president , the resolution under section 5 (3) ( b ) of the public bus services ordinance seeks to exempt the franchised public bus service operated by the new lantao bus company ( 1973 ) limited ( nlb ) from certain provisions of the profit control scheme . the governor in council has granted a new franchise to the nlb to operate a public bus service with seven routes on lantao island for two years from 1 april 1995 to 31 march 1997 . under the public bus services ordinance , every franchise is subject to a profit control scheme specified in part v of the ordinance unless the legislative council by resolution under section 5 (3) ( b ) excludes the application of any all of the provisions of the scheme . the resolution to be moved by the secretary for transport seeks to disapply those sections governing the permitted return under the profit control scheme . those sections which enable the administration to specify depreciation rates for franchise related assets and to require the company to produce accounts and other information needed for effective monitoring of the company 's performance will be retained . mr president , a subcommittee , of which i am the chairman , was set up to study the resolution . the subcommittee met on 17 january 1995 and discussed the background of the resolution and the operation of public bus service on lantao with the administration . members noted that at present , by virtue of the terms of their respective franchises , none of the franchised bus operators , except the kowloon motor bus company ( 1933 ) limited , is subject to the profit control scheme . they also noted that in july 1993 , the legislative council had approved by resolution to exempt the franchised bus services operated by the china motor bus company limited and the citybus limited from certain provisions of the profit control scheme . in the light of the background information , members generally agreed to support the resolution . they also drew the attention of the administration to their observations on bus services on lantao with a view to bringing about an improvement in the overall situation . members ' suggestions for improvement included the following : (1) in view of the difference in bus fares , the franchised buses and non-franchised buses should each have a distinctive colour scheme to enable passengers to tell them apart ; (2) the order and control at the bus terminus at mui wo need to be improved ; and (3) the licensing of light buses and coaches on lantao should be relaxed to help ease the demand on weekends and holidays . the administration undertook to consider the various points made by members and let the subcommittee have a written reply . mr president , the subcommittee supports the resolution and recommends that it be supported . thank you , mr president . secretary for transport : mr president , i am most grateful to the honourable lee wing - tat and to the honourable members of the subcommittee for their comments and suggestions relating to bus services on lantau island . the administration will study these proposals . thank you , mr president . question on the motion put and agreed to . legislative council ( electoral provisions ) ordinance the secretary for constitutional affairs moved the following motion : schedule the following shall apply in relation to the determination of 6 representatives for registration as electors in relation to a member ( other than an individual member ) of the hong kong council of social service - ( a ) if the number of applications - ( i ) from eligible persons ( excluding any person to whom a restriction in section 14 of the legislative council ( electoral provisions ) ordinance ( cap . 381 ) applies ) ; ( ii ) for such registration in relation to a particular member ; and ( ii ) has also made an application pursuant to paragraph ( b ) ( iii ) for registration in another functional constituency , the registration officer shall determine whether such person is entitled to be registered in that functional constituency , as if the application had been made under section 9 of the boundary and election commission ( registration of electors ) ( functional constituencies and election committee constituency ) regulation ( l.n. 585 of 1994 ) ; ( h ) in this schedule - ( i ) " maximum number " means , in relation to a member ( other than an individual member ) of the hong kong council of social service , the number specified in note (8) ( c ) to schedule 2 to the legislative council ( electoral provisions ) ordinance ( cap . 381 ) as being the maximum number of persons that can be registered as electors in relation to such a member ; ( ii ) the references to " 1 may " and " 1 june " shall be construed as 1 may and 1 june respectively in the year for which the relevant provisional register is being compiled under the boundary and election commission ( registration of electors ) ( functional constituencies and election committee constituency ) regulation ( l.n. 585 of 1994 ) . " he said : mr president , i move the resolution standing in my name in the order paper . this resolution is made under note (8) ( c ) to schedule 2 to the legislative council ( electoral provisions ) ordinance . the note provides that in the social welfare functional constituency , no more than six representatives of each of the agency member of the hong kong council of social service ( hkcss ) , determined in a manner to be provided by resolution of this council , shall be registered as electors in that constituency . the purpose of this resolution is to set out the arrangements for registering up to six representatives of each of the agency member of the hkcss . in line with the arrangements for registering individual electors in the other functional constituencies which have corporate members , we propose that , for the sake of consistency , the registration of agency representatives should follow those already provided for in section 10 of the boundary and election commission ( registration of electors ) ( functional constituencies and election committee constituency ) regulation . in brief , lots will be drawn if the applications for voter registration under an agency should exceed the quota of six by 1 may . unsuccessful applicants , if they are also eligible to register in other non-corporate functional constituencies , will then have an opportunity to register by 1 june in another functional constituency if they fail to represent an hkcss agency after the drawing of lots . these procedures will be clearly explained to the agencies concerned by the registration officer . the registration and electoral office has now started the registration of electors for the functional constituencies . the urgent passage of this resolution is necessary so that the registration officer can also register eligible representatives of the agencies of the hkcss in the social welfare functional constituency . i hope members will give their support to this resolution . mr president , i beg to move . question on the motion proposed , put and agreed to . bankruptcy ordinance the secretary for financial services moved the following motion : " that the bankruptcy ( forms ) ( amendment ) rules 1995 , made by the chief justice on 3 january 1995 , be approved . " he said : mr president , i move the first motion in my name on the order paper . the bankruptcy ( forms ) ( amendment ) order was made by the chief justice on 3 january 1995 . it provides for the repeal of the current statement of affairs form and its replacement by two new forms . form 28 of the bankruptcy ( forms ) rules must be submitted to the official receiver by all persons against whom a receiving order is made . in the course of a review of the statutory forms in use in relation to bankruptcies , this form was found to be in need of substantial updating . as some bankruptcies do not involve the collapse of an individual 's business , it was considered more appropriate to have two types of form , one for a non - trading individual and one for a trader . these forms have been designed to obtain all the necessary information about a debtor 's affairs in a clear and straightforward manner . debtors should find the new alternative forms easier to complete than the single form currently in use . mr president , i beg to move . question on the motion proposed , put and agreed to . companies ordinance the secretary for financial services moved the following motion : " that the companies ( winding - up ) ( amendment ) rules 1995 , made by the chief justice on 3 january 1995 , be approved . " he said : mr president , i move the second motion in my name on the order paper . the companies ( winding - up ) ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) order was made by the chief justice on 3 january 1995 . it provides for the repeal of the current statement of affairs form and its replacement by a new form . the government has conducted a review of statutory forms in use in company liquidations to ensure that they remain relevant and up to date . form 23 of the forms contained in the appendix to the companies ( winding - up ) rules has to be submitted to the official receiver by directors and other persons where the court makes an order for the winding up of a company or the appointment of a provisional liquidator . this form was found to be in need of substantial amendment . the form has been redesigned to make it more user - friendly and to obtain all the relevant information about a company 's affairs in a clear and straightforward manner . mr president , i beg to move . question on the motion proposed , put and agreed to . legal aid ( amendment ) bill 1995 motor vehicles insurance ( third party risks ) ( amendment ) bill 1995 employees ' compensation ( amendment ) bill 1995 housing ( amendment ) bill 1995 bills read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to standing order 41 (3) . second reading of bills legal aid ( amendment ) bill 1995 the chief secretary moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the legal aid ordinance . " he said : mr president , i move that the legal aid ( amendment ) bill 1995 be read the second time . the bill puts forward a number of amendments to the legal aid ordinance to implement the recommendations of an inter - departmental working group which conducted a comprehensive review of our legal aid services and a number of additional improvement measures proposed by the director of legal aid in the light of the operating experience of the legal aid department . the working party 's report , published in july last year , contains a total of 25 recommendations . some of these were related to the establishment of a legal aid services council , which will be the subject of a separate bill to be introduced into this council shortly . most of the remaining recommendations were intended to introduce improvements to the scope and operation of the legal aid scheme . these require legislative amendments to the legal aid ordinance and some subsidiary legislation . i now outline the major improvements provided for in the present legal aid ( amendment ) bill . clauses 3 and 5 of the bill provide for increases in the financial eligibility limits for both the standard legal aid scheme and the self-financing supplementary legal aid scheme for the so - called sandwich class . the increases take into account the level of inflation since the current limits were set . the bill also meets the public demand for greater access to legal aid . clauses 4 and 13 expand the scope of the standard civil legal aid scheme . as a matter of human rights policy , we propose to give the director of legal aid the discretion to waive the means test in any civil case where an applicant has a meritorious bill of rights claim . we also propose that legal aid be extended to persons making applications to the mental health review tribunal against their detention in a mental hospital or the correctional services department psychiatric centre , and to persons who pursue election petitions on bill of rights grounds . clause 14 of the bill seeks to include in the scope of the supplementary legal aid scheme claims involving professional negligence on the part of medical doctors , dentists and lawyers . finally , the opportunity is also taken to streamline some operating practices . for example , clause 8 seeks to clarify the application of a first charge by the director of legal aid on any property recovered or preserved for an aided person in proceedings in respect of which the person was legally aided . it also recognizes the present practice whereby the director does not impose a first charge on maintenance payments to children . the existing privileges against disclosing information in connection with a legal aid application are clarified in clause 9 of the bill . bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . motor vehicles insurance ( third party risks ) ( amendment ) bill 1995 the secretary for financial services moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the motor vehicles insurance ( third party risks ) ordinance . " he said : mr president , i move the second reading of the motor vehicles insurance ( third party risks ) ( amendment ) bill 1995 . the main purpose of the bill is to require motorists to purchase a minimum amount of insurance cover in respect of their liabilities for motor vehicle third party bodily injuries , in place of the requirement for unlimited insurance cover under the existing motor vehicles insurance ( third party risks ) ordinance ( mvio ) . bearing in mind the need to ensure that the public is adequately protected , we propose that the minimum amount of insurance cover be set at $100 million for any one event . direct insurers in hong kong have so far been able to provide unlimited insurance cover to motorists to insure against their liabilities for motor vehicle third party bodily injuries by relying on the unlimited reinsurance cover provided by reinsurers . however , following recent shrinkage in reinsurance capacity in the international market , reinsurers in hong kong have concluded that it is no longer commercially viable for them to provide unlimited reinsurance cover for this type of policy . without unlimited reinsurance protection , direct insurers cannot continue providing unlimited insurance coverage to motorists in hong kong . consequently , the requirements of the mvio , under which a motorist must take out unlimited insurance cover , can no longer be met . it is therefore necessary to amend the ordinance to specify a minimum obligatory cover that would provide adequate protection for the injured in such circumstances . the proposed limit of $100 million for any one event is considered appropriate having regard to the capacity of reinsurers to meet claims upon insurers . in proposing this amount , consideration has also been given to the fact that the largest claims for motor vehicle third party bodily injuries insurance have so far not exceeded $15 million per event . i would like to add that the proposed amendments will not prejudice the right of an injured person to seek compensation over and above the limit of $100 million in the unlikely event that liabilities exceeded that amount . any excess above the limit will be payable out of the assets of the insured . if any excess liabilities remain unpaid thereafter , the rights of the injured party will be further protected by the compensation funds maintained by the motor insurers ' bureau of hong kong . in addition , the bill proposes to exempt vehicles used exclusively on construction and industrial sites from the requirement for compulsory third party insurance under the mvio . such vehicles have always been regarded as plant and equipment . it has been the market practice to insure them by standard all risks insurance policies , not by motor vehicle ( third party risks ) insurance policies . however , an amendment to the road traffic ordinance in 1988 unintentionally may have had the effect of requiring vehicles on industrial and construction sites to be compulsorily insured against third party risks under the mvio . this in turn may have had the effect of rendering null and void any standard all risks insurance held by contractors for site based vehicles , as such policies exclude liabilities compulsorily insurable under any legislation . in other words , there is a risk that third party claims arising in connection with site based vehicles will not be entertained under the standard all risks insurance policies , resulting in losses to claimants . we propose to rectify this situation by exempting site based vehicles from the compulsory third party insurance requirements under the mvio , thereby placing liabilities arising in connection with such vehicles clearly within the ambit of the standard all risks insurance policies taken out by contractors . mr president , the motor vehicles insurance ( third party risks ) ( amendment ) bill 1995 is the result of the concerted efforts of the financial services branch , transport branch and works branch . i therefore speak also for my colleagues , the secretary for transport and the secretary for works , in commending the bill to this council . bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . employees ' compensation ( amendment ) bill 1995 the secretary for financial services moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the employees ' compensation ordinance . " he said : mr president , i move the second reading of the employees ' compensation ( amendment ) bill 1995 . the bill seeks to require employers to purchase a minimum amount of insurance cover of $100 million in respect of their liabilities for employees ' compensation , in place of the requirement for unlimited insurance cover under the existing employees ' compensation ordinance . i have already explained the reasons for such an amendment when moving the second reading of the motor vehicles insurance ( third party risks ) ( amendment ) bill 1995 . the proposed limit of $100 million for any one event is also considered adequate in the case of employee compensation : the largest claims for employees ' compensation insurance have so far not exceeded $30 million per event . it is also true that in the unlikely event that liabilities exceeded the limit of $100 million , any excess will be payable out of the assets of the insured in the first instance , then out of the compensation funds maintained by the employees ' compensation assistance fund board . mr president , the employees ' compensation ( amendment ) bill 1995 is the result of the concerted efforts of the financial services branch and the education and manpower branch . i therefore speak also for my colleague , the secretary for education and manpower , in commending the bill to this council . bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . housing ( amendment ) bill 1995 the secretary for housing moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the housing ordinance . " he said : mr president , i move the second reading of the housing ( amendment ) bill 1995 . the purpose of this bill is to update and improve several provisions in the housing ordinance . two significant and two minor amendments are proposed . first , clause 4 of the bill empowers the secretary for housing to appoint , under new section 7a of the ordinance , a panel of members to hear appeals under section 20 (1) of the ordinance against termination of leases by the hong kong housing authority ( ha ) . the bill also empowers the secretary for housing to make rules regulating the procedure for appeals to the panel . at present , the ha is responsible for appointing such a panel and for making such rules . this arrangement is not satisfactory as the ha is a party to these appeals , and hence the amendments are proposed . furthermore , to ensure independence and impartiality regarding the handling of appeals , the secretary for housing will in future only appoint persons who are not members of the ha to the appeal panel . second , clause 6 of the bill seeks to deter the creation of mortgages or charges not authorized by the ha by making them void and rendering offenders liable to prosecution . paragraph 4 of the schedule to the ordinance permits a flat purchaser under the home ownership scheme or the private sector participation scheme to mortgage or charge the land only on such terms as are authorized by the director of housing . it has come to our notice that some mortgages for these flats have been created without the director of housing 's authorization . legal advice is that it would not be appropriate to take prosecution action on the basis of this schedule . we therefore propose the addition of a new section to clarify the legal position and to make people who borrow on the basis of unauthorized mortgages or charges liable to prosecution . third , clause 3 of the bill expressly empowers the ha to employ its own staff , consultants and advisers . section 4 (2) ( k ) of the ordinance provides the ha with the general power to do all such acts as are reasonably necessary for the performance of its duties . legal advice is that although existing contracts of employment can be justified under this section , the ha should be given specific power to employ its own staff and advisory services . this will put the validity of any future contract of employment beyond doubt . the fourth amendment , under clause 5 , enables the director of housing to delegate any of his functions to officers of a specified class or description . this removes the need for him to appoint long lists of public officers frequently under section 10 of the ordinance . thank you , mr president . bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . public health and municipal services ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1994 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 2 november 1994 question on the

27a , i am required to direct any member speaking in excess of the specified time to discontinue his speech . health care plan for the elderly mr fred li moved the following motion : " that this council urges the government to set up a community - based comprehensive health care plan for persons aged 60 or above , so as to provide adequate health care for the elderly . " mr fred li : mr president , i move the motion standing in my name in the order paper , that is " that this council urges the government to set up a community - based comprehensive health care plan for persons aged 60 or above , so as to provide adequate health care for the elderly . " the original motion contained the word " medical " , but with the president 's permission , the word " medical " has been deleted , which in turn allay the anxieties of the medical sector , particularly the medical practitioners . perhaps i shall come back to this point when the motion is put into debate . with the continuous aging of the population in hong kong , health problems of the elderly have become a focal issue which we can no longer afford to neglect . in fact , the annual expenditure on medical services for the elderly is enormous , and given the aging of our population , such expenditure is bound to increase as time goes by . in the year 1993/94 , the expenditure on hospital services for the elderly reached $1.45 billion , and the same kind of expenditure for the year 1994/95 is estimated to be $1.71 billion approximately . this shows the enormity of the expenditure involved , and reflects both the necessity and significance of elderly health care services . heart disease , hypertension and diabetes are the most common illnesses among elderly people . should they have access to timely medical check - ups and proper treatment at an early stage , the threat posed by such diseases will be reduced accordingly . from the viewpoint of cost - effectiveness , improved health of the elderly will mean a lighter financial burden for the government . there is no question that the government has made some efforts in this area . in his 1992 policy address , the governor promised to set up seven health care centres to provide senior citizens with annual medical check - ups , health care education and counselling services . the first of these centres , located at nam shan estate , tai hang tung , was commissioned in may 1994 , and i have visited it myself . the second one will come into operation early this year , while the third one is still under planning . basically , the setting up of elderly health care centres to provide integrated health care services should be supported . however , it must be pointed out that even when all the 7 health care centres have come into full operation , the services provided will still be insufficient . in view of this , i have put forth this motion debate , in the hope that health care services for the elderly can be expanded to cover all elderly people aged 60 or above , so that their health can be better taken care of . i understand that alongside the elderly health care centres set up by the government , some small scale elderly health care programmes are being operated by non-government organizations funded by the community chest . the united christian medical service board , for example , is running the kwun tong community health development programme , which provides services to the senior citizens living in the district . in addition , there are at present 3 psychogeriatric teams under the hospital authority , which will create 4 community geriatric teams and one more psychogeriatric team in the year 1994/95 . in the report of the working group on care for the elderly published last october , it was proposed that four community geriatric team and four psychogeriatric teams should be created . such outreaching services for the elderly include weekly visits to various homes for the elderly , where the inmates are provided with services such as diagnosis , follow - up consultation , referral and health care education . conceptually , the health care services for the elderly mentioned above are quite good . it is a pity , however , that we lack a systematic and community - based health care plan capable of effecting overall planning and co-ordination . as a result , these services have become fragmentary and loose . community - based services are in fact no new idea . the report of the working party on primary health care published as early as december 1990 already laid down the concept of community - based health care services for the elderly . in a moment , the honourable wong wai - yin of the democratic party will give a more detailed account of the concept of community - based services and their financial implications . now , let me turn to the details of our six recommendations : (1) a full - scale health care plan for the elderly aimed at providing at least one annual medical check - up for every hong kong resident aged 60 or above . at present , the target users of the elderly health care centres at nam shan estate are senior citizens aged 65 or above . and , according to the report of the working group on care for the elderly , the age requirement in the planning ratio for elderly services will be revised from the present 60 to 65 . however , it must be pointed out that the earlier preventive health care services are available , the better . if senior citizens cannot enjoy health care services until the age of 65 , such services will be of little help to them . life in a modern city is tense , and there are signs that more and more young people are suffering from chronic diseases , such as heart disease hypertension , and diabetes . given this , there is no justification for fixing 65 as the age for entitlement to elderly health care services . therefore , we suggest that the qualifying age should be set at 60 or even earlier . (2) extension of health care centres for the elderly to all the 18 administrative districts , with at least one in each . the number of people aged 65 or above is already over half a million on its own . if people aged between 60 and 64 are also counted , the size of our elderly population will exceed 750 000 . assuming that each health care centre has an annual serving capacity of 3 000 people , then even when all the seven health care centres are in full operation , only a mere total of about 21 000 elderly people can receive health care services every year , which is far behind the actual demand . with the aging of the population in hong kong , the demand for these services is bound to increase . for this reason , it is absolutely necessary for the government to expand the services of elderly health care centres as soon as possible . in the meantime , the government should make good use of existing resources . funds should be allocated through department of health to non-government organizations such as the united christian medical service board so as to encourage them to set up elderly health care centres . (3) encouraging all private medical practitioners in hong kong to participate in the plan , with each district elderly health care centre responsible for co - ordination , so as to set up community - based elderly health care services . as i have just mentioned , there are more than 750 000 people aged 60 or above in hong kong . given this , even if we set up one elderly health care centre in each district , their demand cannot be satisfied completely because only around 7% of them could have access to the services . therefore , we suggest that the government should discuss the plan with private medical practitioners and encourage them to participate . this can reduce the government 's pressure on the one hand and greatly expedite the expansion of the services on the other . at present , over 7 000 private medical practitioners are practising all over hong kong . their participation will constitute an immense pool of resources for the future expansion of health care services for the elderly . our tentative proposal is that each district elderly health care centre should be charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating the work of the participating private medical practitioners within its own district . it should also make arrangements for elderly people to attend yearly physical check - ups in the private clinics near their own homes . should any problems be detected , the patient should be referred to the clinics administered by the department of health or the hospital authority . in this way , community - based services can be set up . (4) strengthening the links among district elderly health care centres , government out - patient clinics , hospitals and private medical practitioners , with a view to establishing a comprehensive medical network in the provision of integrated services . district elderly health care centres should maintain close contacts with government out - patient clinics , hospitals and private medical practitioners and they should also conduct assessment studies on the general health conditions of the senior citizens living in their own districts . in this way , the demand for and supply of elderly medical services can be worked out , and co-ordinated efforts can be made in response , thus facilitating the setting up a comprehensive network of medical services . on the other hand , the hospital authority should continue it efforts in expanding outreaching medical services for the elderly . apart from the inmates of homes for the elderly or convalescent homes , outreaching medical services should be extended to privately - run elderly homes and elderly people on comprehensive social security assistance who are living alone . outreaching services for the elderly and the work of elderly health care centres must be co-ordinated so that they can complement one another . (5) strengthening the links between the department of health and the social welfare department to give greater assistance to elderly people on comprehensive social security assistance who are living alone . let us take the elderly health care centre at nam shan estate as an example . the centre has a membership of about 1 000 , of whom only 10% are in receipt of comprehensive social security assistance ( cssa ) . this percentage is on the low side , and i think publicity work is obviously far from adequate . very often elderly people on cssa who are living alone seldom participate in community activities or join any health care centres . many of them are even illiterate , and thus have very limited access to information about the outside world . but , at the same time , it is the health of this the group of people that causes us most concern . therefore , elderly health care centres should step up their publicity work in this particular area . their ties with the social welfare department should be strengthened so that , through outreaching services , their meaningful services can be publicized among those elderly people on cssa who are living alone . (6) creation of social workers posts at elderly health care centres we have visited the elderly health care centre at nam shan estate , and found that at present only one doctor and two nurses work there , but no social workers are stationed . this shows a lack of thoroughness in the implementation elderly health care services . medical staff very often can only understand the psychical conditions of their patients , but when it comes to the mental health of the elderly , social workers will be better suited to the job . therefore , social workers should be stationed at elderly health care centres to strengthen mental health counselling services for the elderly . such social workers can at the same time devote time to strengthen ties with other organizations in the community , so that more senior citizens , particularly those who rarely participate in community activities , can be encouraged to use the services provided by the elderly health care centres . apart from the 6 specific recommendations mentioned above , i want to put forward one more suggestion . i have recently approached several hundred of senior citizens in the kwun tong district to seek their opinions about this motion debate . they have expressed considerable concern about their dental health because of its direct effect on their eating and digestion . however , the government now provides dental care service to school children only . adults are not provided with any dental care service , let alone dental treatment . therefore , the government should consider ways and means of including dental care for the elderly in the existing dental services . furthermore , since some elderly people aged 60 or above may still have to work , if the health care centres are open from nine to five only , working elderly people will be greatly inconvenienced . therefore , the government should consider the possibility of extending the opening hours of the health care centres to somewhere between 7 p.m and 8 p.m so that those senior citizens who still have to work can also enjoy the health care services provided . mr president , if the plan we advocate is implemented , all senior citizens in hong kong will benefit because they will then have a better understanding of their own health and can thus take preventive measures against diseases . in case health problems are detected , early treatment can be sought , thus reducing unnecessary suffering and even the incidence of death . moreover , the plan can ease the demand - and - supply tension now confronting our medical services . as a result , the government can be more flexible in appropriating resources to raise the quantity as well as the quality of other social services . finally , as the lunar new year is approaching , i wish to take this opportunity to express my new year wishes in advance to all senior citizens in hong kong . may i wish them good health and a happy life , so that they could spend their twilight years very happily in sound health . mr president , with these remarks , i beg to move . question on the motion proposed . president : mr tam yiu - chung has given notice to move an amendment to the motion . his amendment has been printed in the order paper and circulated to members . i propose to call on him to speak and to move his amendment now so that members may debate the motion and the amendment together . mr tam yiu - chung moved the following amendment to mr fred li 's motion : " to delete " set up " and substitute by " ensure the provision of adequate resources for the introduction of " ; to add after " health care plan " the words " as well as other social and counselling services " ; to delete " , so as to provide adequate health care for " and substitute by " so that the health of " ; and to add after " the elderly " the following " , particularly those with difficulties in mobility , is well taken care of " . " mr tam yiu - chung : mr president , i move to amend the honourable fred li 's motion . the amendment is set out in the order paper . i move the amendment for two reasons . the first reason is to urge the government to provide adequate resources and the second reason is to urge them to strengthen other social and counselling services . as regards the first reason , the government has to ensure the provision of adequate resources before a community - wide health care plan for the elderly can be successfully implemented . the health centres for the elderly as suggested by mr fred li are in fact already in existence , but they are not in sufficient quantity to cater for all the elderly people . there are already many health care and medical services for the elderly , but the quality of such services has deteriorated because of inadequate funding . to cite an example , owing to the lack of mini-bus services to take the elderly people to and from the day care centres , many elderly people who live in the remote areas and have difficulties in moving around cannot participate in the recreational and health care activities organized especially for them . besides , many outreaching service teams which work for the elderly have failed to reach or take care of the so - called " concealed " single elderly people because of inadequate subsidies from the government . therefore , i think the crux of the problem is the shortage of resources of expanding the services and that is why my amendment stresses primarily that the government should ensure the provision of adequate resources . insofar as the second point is concerned , i think the services to be provided by the health centres for the elderly as proposed by mr fred li are not extensive enough . so i emphasize the strengthening of social and counselling services in my amendment . according to the report of the working group on care for the elderly published towards the end of last year , the rate of suicide of the elderly people is comparatively higher than other age groups in hong kong . the main reason is that old people are being forsaken following the dissolution of big family structure and the emigration trend in recent years . this , coupled with the fact that old people will easily become ill , has led to their emotional disturbance . when they are lack of proper care both physically and psychologically , they will easily have a suicidal rumination . in my opinion , a comprehensive health care service plan for the elderly should include the provision of psychological counselling and psychotherapy , apart from just taking care of their physical health . it is hoped that the health centres for the elderly as strongly urged by mr fred li will , as proposed in the report of the working group on care for the elderly , provide adequate and comprehensive services including psychological counselling and psychotherapy for the elderly . lastly , i have to make one more point . mr fred li has proposed to set up a health centre for the elderly in each administrative district , which is to be co-ordinated by private medical practitioners . however , he did not specify who should pay for the expenses . should it be the government or the private sector ? i am therefore worried that the motion of mr li will finally become merely an idle talk . also , he has used the term " health care " in his motion which is such a vague idea that i am afraid it may like the school medical scheme which is being abused . we therefore need to discuss the source of funding . mr president , these are my remarks . i beg to move the amendment and hope my honourable colleagues will support it . mr hui yin - fat : mr president , there is a trend of continuous growth in the average life expectancy of the elderly in hong kong . this is a good phenomenon which reflects our economic prosperity and advanced medical technology . however , if there are insufficient primary health care services with no retirement protection , the longer the life expectancy of old people , the more physical suffering they would have to endure , and an even heavier burden will be placed on the already immensely funded medical expenses . in view of this , the governor promised in his 1992 policy address that seven health centres for the elderly will be established by 1997 . this was welcomed by the general public who believed that the government had begun to stress on the importance and contribution of primary health care services ; however , after a lapse of two years or more , only one centre is providing services ; the second one is yet to be established and the third one is still under preparation . we are worried how the objective could be achieved by 1997 . in fact , with only seven health centres for the elderly in the entire territory , it is definitely impossible to meet the tremendous demand of more than 700 000 old people aged 60 or above . therefore , it is necessary to strengthen the existing related services to facilitate co - ordination and for different services to complement one another . in addition , development can be expedited by making the best use of the participation of non-governmental organizations . as regards the existing nursing services provided to the elderly , i have the following four views and suggestions : firstly , the biggest difference between health care and medical care lies in the fact that the former puts particular emphasis on preventive work , which is to slow down the pace at which bodily functions decline . therefore , health care services for the elderly should commence at the age of 60 instead of 65 which is currently set as the age for receiving elderly services . secondly , the existing health care services for the elderly are jointly provided by a number of departments or organizations , including the hospital authority , the department of health , the social welfare department and some voluntary organizations , and inevitably there exists little co-ordination and co-operation among them . therefore , i would like to reiterate the consistent position of the hong kong council of social services , that is , a central committee on services for the elderly should be set up with a view to improving the efficiency of the resources . as regards co-ordination at the district level , although a co - ordination mechanism has already been in place , it has to be re-organized and strengthened if we were to improve the mutual support and co-operation among different departments and organizations . thirdly , the medical outreaching teams under the hospital authority have been putting too much emphasis on care and attention homes to which medical practitioners and allied medical professionals have been paying regular visits . this may result in unnecessary duplication and even wastage of resources . on the contrary , to those who live in homes for the aged or in hostels for the elderly where medical care is rather deficient , and also to those old people living alone or with their families in communities , the government is paying relatively less attention . therefore , in the spirit of mutual help in the community , and in the hope of providing necessary support to the care - givers of the elderly both in the families and in the hostels , the administration should extend the services provided by the medical outreaching teams to those old people who have not yet benefited and to those care - givers who have not been given adequate support yet . lastly , although the hospital authority has in recent years succeeded in reducing the number of camp beds in hospitals , the measures adopted by the administration have not been recognized by the public . for example , for the purpose of enhancing the mobility of patients , some hospitals order patients to be discharged before they are ready , and as a result , their families or the hostels where they live are unable to provide them with sufficient and appropriate care after their discharge from hospitals . therefore , the administration should employ more medical social workers and reinforce their resources , in addition to drawing up a plan for the discharge of patients , so as to ensure that continuous medical services and medical care can be provided to the elderly after they have been discharged from hospital and returned to their respective communities . mr president , in the light of the contribution of health centres for the elderly in cutting down the overall medical expenses and the need to cope with the tremendous demand , i think the request of the original motion is not excessively demanding . the government should , at least , have such a long - term objective . during this rather lengthy transition period , the government should encourage the private practitioners and social service agencies operating in the districts to participate to a certain extent in community - based health care plans for the elderly , so that the elderly , whether they are well - off or worse - off , may enjoy better health and spend their twilight years in comfort . the old people may even take part in voluntary work again , and make contributions to the community whilst enjoying their enriched twilight years . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . dr leong che - hung : mr president , may i first start by thanking my honourable colleague , mr fred li , for changing the words of his motion on health care for the elderly at the eleventh hour , and of course thanking you , mr president , for allowing such a change at such a short notice . as a result of such change , the spirit of my initial amendment has been properly reflected . i therefore seek your permission , mr president , to withdraw the amendment under my name . although the controversy is now water under the bridge , i thought it my obligation to explain to members of this council the reasons behind my initial move to amend mr fred li 's original motion . honourable members can rest assured that it is neither a political move nor some sort of in - fighting among political parties of this council . the original words of mr fred li 's motion call upon the government to provide a " comprehensive medical and health care plan " for the elderly over 60 years of age . his current motion calls only for the provision of a " comprehensive health care plan " . honourable members may remember that when mr fred li spoke on his motion and called for a health care plan , he had made allowance for the involvement of private medical practitioners , and so it should be . members of my profession , mr president , in private practice are more than willing to offer their services by providing physical check - up and health education to our senior citizens . all these could be done on a regular basis with the fixed cost met by the government . indeed many of my colleagues are already voluntarily providing medical care at a reduced charge for senior citizens . on the other hand , if the call is for a comprehensive medical plan also , we are engaging in an entirely different " ball game " . in essence , private medical practitioners will then be requested to provide a system whereby for a specific sum of money senior citizens could seek unlimited medical treatment on a yearly basis . such a possible proposed scheme brings back the foul memory of the soon - to - be - scrapped school medical scheme which has opened so many doors for abuses and up to now has landed two doctors in jail and a third saved only by the skin of his teeth when prosecution has to drop charges following the death of a key witness . mr president , it is therefore a comprehensive health care plan and not a comprehensive medical and health care plan that we should pursue . no society can claim to be a caring society if it does not cater to the health of its aging population . a health care plan for the elderly is therefore in dire need . such a comprehensive plan will be able to achieve a proper health education for our senior citizens so as to reduce the incidence of illness . at the same time , through a regular check - up , early detection of illness can be achieved and the senior citizens referred to a proper medical care service . in short , a proper comprehensive health care plan is not just for health but also for health economics . it is with this in mind that the working party on primary health care in its 1990 report recommended that the mission for elderly health care should be : " to promote the health and well - being of the elderly through provision of community - based services " , with the objectives of providing and promoting " community - based non-institutional health care services for the elderly including the development of health maintenance and health promotion programmes with a view to preventing or deferring the need for long - term institutional care " . needless to say , to make this effective , the government must provide in parallel improved public medical care facilities so that any senior citizens detected to have ill health could get the necessary treatment at the earliest possible time . it was therefore with jubilation that the community received the policy direction of the governor 's policy address in 1992 which called for the establishment of health centres for the elderly . but alas , it is a situation of too little and too late . a total of only seven such centres were proposed as a pilot scheme to look after the whole elderly population of over 750 000 in hong kong . up to now only one centre has been commissioned in nam shan . a second one is in the pipeline but no further plans are obvious for the remaining . is this then yet again another example of procrastination or is this yet another example of paying lip service , raising the hopes of our senior citizens to high heaven , yet never allowing them to taste the sweetness of realization of a genuine promise ? mr president , if the government is serious in its push for a health care plan for the elderly , the following criteria must be taken and turned into reality : ( a ) there should be at least one such centre for each of the 18 districts so that the growing number of senior citizens can be effectively taken care of ; ( b ) such centres should co-ordinate with the private sector to involve them in the provision of health education and regular check - up ; ( c ) such centres should be in the vicinity of an adequately functioning general out - patient clinic so as to provide the necessary curative service ; ( d ) the services of the centre must be comprehensive and with a full range of services including the provision of oral and dental health care , and , as mr tam yiu - chung said , mental care at the same time ; and ( e ) opening hours of the centres must be flexible so that the carers for these senior citizens could have ample time to take them to , and fetch them from , the elderly health centres and yet have time to meet their own schedule of work . finally , mr president , health promotion and sickness prevention must begin at a young age . it is ineffective in the control of hypertension , heart disease and so on , when people only start to cut down their fat and rich food at the age of 60 . similarly , it does little to decrease lung diseases if you have been a chain smoker all the way up to 60 years old . it is embarrassing to say the least that in spite of our vibrant economic state , we in hong kong still do not have a set of health targets . mr president , looking after the health of our citizens in their twilight years needs more than just a few elderly health centres or just some ad hoc activities . we need a well - thought - out health policy with a long vision . this , with regret , the government has so far consistently resisted to produce . i support both the motion and the amendment . the president ' s deputy , mrs elsie tu , took the chair . mr tik chi yuen : madam deputy , at present , about 13% of our six million population are elderly people above the age of 60 . this percentage will rise to about 18% by the year 2001 . like other countries , hong kong now faces the problem of an aging population . many advanced countries like japan have planned well ahead . they have good medicial and healthcare programmes for their elderly because they understand that the medical services required by the elderly could exceed those needed by the younger people by two or three times . hence , if we wish to promote the health of the elderly , we should give them prompt medical treatment , and prevent them from falling ill , thus reducing their frequency for hospitalization . developing a health care programme for the elderly is therefore cost - effective . however , over the years , the medical services of the government have made no substantial improvements to cater for the aging population and to gear to the trend of diseases . twenty years ago , the 1974 white paper on " the future development of medical and health services in hong kong " was published , and since then , reform of the medical services of hong kong has been presented to the public in a piecemeal fashion . for the last two years , however , the policy address began to pay some more attention to the welfare and health of the elderly . the policy address of 1992 pledged that the government would establish seven health centres for the elderly by 1997 . it was undoubtedly a good start . unfortunately , the government 's plan to build health centres for the elderly has a " glamourous start but a disappointing ending " . progress has been very slow . at present , only one health centre for the elderly has been commissioned in hong kong , and this is very much short of the targeted number set in the policy address . there are now more than 700 000 elderly people in hong kong and it is estimated that 15% of the residents of public housing estates are elderly people , some of whom even live alone . bearing in mind that some elderly people might have difficulties in moving around or might live in remote areas of the new territories , the proposal of extending territory - wide health centre services for the elderly to cover all the 18 administrative districts deserves our attention . besides increase in quantity , the improvement of quality is also very important . i think the government should address the needs of the elderly through a health care programme in which the following corresponding measures should be worked out : (1) health education for the elderly early detection , coupled with proper treatment and control can greatly reduce the incidence of many common illnesses among the elderly . take stroke as an example . the medical profession has confirmed that the mortality rate caused by stroke can be greatly reduced if hypertension of the elderly can be properly treated and kept under control . hence , prevention is the key to an effective health care plan . it is especially important to explain to our senior citizens the preventive measures against various illnesses which are common among the elderly . for example , telling them what to consider when choosing their diets , the ingredients of various kinds of food , how they would affect their health , and so on . in fact , the hospital authority has all along been providing primary medical care services . the hospital authority has stressed that medical care services should not be impeded by " any structural restrictions " and through the " shared care programme " , it has been co-operating with the primary medical care services providers ( including private practitioners ) and the department of health . their targets are the rehabilitating and chronically - ill patients . i think that the hospital authority should similiarly co-operate with the health centres for the elderly to develop primary health education for the elderly . in this way , the elderly can obtain some basic knowledge on health . (2) liaison group to promote the health of the elderly i think it is not enough for the elderly to have only one medical check - up every year . hence , i suggest the government should set up liaison groups to promote the health of the elderly in the health centres so that the elderly can exchange ideas and help one another to understand how to prevent illness . we also ask the the government to create posts of social workers in the health centres to help in the above - mentioned publicity work and to provide counselling services on health for the elderly . medical care services providers often focus their attention on the physical health of the elderly . i believe that after the posts of social worker have been increased , the social workers , with their professional knowledge , can help the elderly learn how to prevent illnesses through mutual encouragement . (3) rising rate of suicides among the elderly although hong kong does not rank first in terms of suicidal rate of the elderly , the number is still appalling . in 1994 , 36.4 out of every 100 000 people aged above 60 committed suicide , and 75 out of every 100 000 men aged above 75 died after committing suicides . we believe the most important factor accounting for suicides committed by the elderly is the lack of support services . many elderly people resorted to suicide because of chronic illness , lack of care and poor relationship with their family . at present , there are of 10 suicide - prevention counselling services in hong kong but only two of them specifically cater for the needs of the elderly . i think that the government should , through its health care programme forth elderly , provide more counselling services to prevent the elderly from committing suicide . madam deputy , all in all , it is very disappointing that the government has failed to work out a comprehensive plan to improve its medical services to cope with the aging population of hong kong over the past few decades . we are proud to say that the people of hong kong have all along been working hard and striving to make progress . however , it would reduce us to shame when we look at the kind of care and welfare which the hong kong government has provided for the elderly . in other developed countries , the elderly who have contributed to their society when they were young would receive basic care provided by their countries . for example , in japan , not only are the elderly medically insured , those aged 70 and above can also join their medical care programme free of charge . the elderly of hong kong , even in the 1990s , are still fighting for some very basic health care services . by comparison , that is very unfortunate indeed . i hope that the government officials concerned will immediately implement a comprehensive health care plan for the elderly immediately , which should not be considered as a token of charity or a gift from above . it is a well - deserved basic right for the elderly who have worked hard for so many years . madam deputy , with these remarks , i support the motion . dr tang siu - tong : madam deputy , the problem concerning medical and health care for the elderly in hong kong is of considerable gravity . with advanced developments in the medical field , problems brought about by an aging population gradually emerge . at present , there are over 700 000 elderly people at the age of 60 or above in hong kong . the provision of a community - based comprehensive health care plan by the government to ensure adequate health care for the elderly has become a task which brooks no delay . mr eric li just now proposed that the government should provide physical check - ups for elderly aged over 60 at least once a year . while i agree to his proposal , i am of the view that preventive health care should be carried out much earlier . to provide physical check - ups for elderly aged over 60 can only detect earlier whether an elderly person is suffering from any illness . most of the chronic illnesses start to develop when the person is still young . in this connection , the government should provide the general public with basic medical knowledge in order to achieve the objective of preventing illnesses . in fact , the elderly may have already been suffering from various kinds of functional damage when he or she reaches 60 . to call for physical check - ups at this time can achieve nothing except " mending the fold after a sheep has been lost " . as regards the idea of encouraging all the private medical practitioners of hong kong to participate in this plan , i think it is worth implementing . in general , many medical practitioners serving at the grass - roots level can be directly involved in medical and health services for the elderly in various forms , for example , by reduction of charges . but i hope this plan will not turn into something like the present school medical scheme which has become low - cost medical care service rather than a physical check - up programme . it will covertly exploit the private medical practitioners in terms of time and effort . mr eric li said there should be social workers posted at health centres for the elderly , thinking that social workers are suitable people for handling the psychological health of the elderly . this i think , is open to question . in my opinion , clinical psychologists are more suitable for this task . there is difference between the medical and community needs of the elderly . we have to distinguish between them . madam deputy , the provision of high quality health care services for the elderly requires financial support . the government should provide adequate resources to cope with the need . without adequate resources , it is like sailing a boat on land , which is far too difficult to proceed . madam deputy , with these remarks , i support mr eric li 's motion and the amendment . mr man sai - cheung : madam deputy , the governor , in his 1992 policy address , promised the setting up of seven elderly health centres to provide the elderly with yearly medical examinations , health care education and couselling services . however , it was not until may 1994 then the first of these health centres started operation . it is , therefore , hardly imaginable when the target as laid down in the policy address can be reached , in order that the elderly can be given access to basic physical examinations as a means of preventing serious diseases . i think it is not that difficult to introduce basic medical examinations and health care education seminars . the question is whether the government really attaches any importance to the matter and whether it is willing to allocate the resources required . the honourable martin lee and i have provided such services in our own offices for the old people living in the eastern district on a regular basis . doctors and nurses are invited to conduct blood pressure measurements and urine tests for them , as well as to give talks on the causes and prevention of various diseases . if the government can allocate funds and provide premises for the rendering of these services , responses from the elderly will surely be enthusiastic provided that large - scale publicity is conducted . therefore , i think that , in the meantime , the government should not just wait for the elderly health centres to be completed , but should instead adopt a more flexible approach to enable the elderly to enjoy these relatively basic health care services at an early date . since medical services for the elderly can cost the government billions of dollars , i believe that medical examinations and seminars conducted on a mobile basis can help alleviate our burden and pressure caused by hospitalization of the elderly . in view of the slow pace in the construction of the elderly health centres , can the authorities concerned consider the feasibility of other methods such as allocating funds as soon as possible to some non-governmental organizations and voluntary agencies for the provision of these services ? in fact , this council has debated the topic of health care for the elderly on many occasions . members have made a lot of efforts to convince the government of the need for relevant policies . however , very little success has been achieved so far . no bold and resolute reform has been introduced in regard to preventive health care for the elderly . after the debate today , i hope the government will really make the first step forward , and properly address the need for health care education and medical examinations for the elderly . this can certainly benefit the elderly because , with a better understanding of their own health , they will know how to prevent diseases and detect health problems more quickly , and can thus seek early treatment . apart from that , and more importantly , public expenditure on medical services can be alleviated in the long run . with these remarks , i support the motion . dr samuel wong : madam deputy , it is moved that the health care plan for the elderly should be comprehensive , which means wide in scope . there are three aspects of this . first , it should cover all phases of health care from prevention to terminal attention . second , it should cover all the needs of a patient from treatment to physical and emotional well - being . third , it should cover all available diagnostic and healing techniques so that the most appropriate can be used . i do not propose to spend time on the detailed needs of the elderly as this is a subject more proper for those in the welfare and health professions . but i do want to stress certain matters of management . some people may think that widening the scope of health care must increase the cost . this is not the case . there are four aspects of elderly health care which can dramatically reduce the cost to the taxpayer . these are : first , prevention ; second , co-ordinating expertise ; third , cost effective procedures ; and fourth , good management and quality assurance . first , prevention . prevention of unnecessary degeneration is substantially a matter of education , which is relatively cheap . it implies self-help , from exercise to diet , to thinking positively - even to laughing . for example , the canadian government puts a sizeable effort into promulgating among their elderly the health - giving properties of friendship . there is no doubt in my mind that money spent on such education would save itself many times over in pre-empting expensive treatment of symptoms brought on by a negative state of mind . second , expertise . expertise in care for the elderly is plentiful in hong kong , but it is scattered . it can be found in the charities , in the religious orders , in the welfare organizations . it will not be found , however , in many of the homes for the elderly that are purely business ventures . many of these , especially the notorious caged bedspaces , have no trained staff and little or no concern for the emotional needs of the residents . education may not be enough in itself . implementation should be part of the plan . indeed , the plan should cover the co-ordination of the available expertise , so that guidelines can be drawn up for the largely neglected emotional care for the elderly . it should address the setting of standards and advisory support for such emotional care in all homes , even family homes , and arrange for the monitoring of compliance with such standards . it should also plan for the training of staff who care for the elderly as this is a specialist subject . i would expect such an approach to more than pay for itself in saving medical resources . third , diagnostic and healing techniques . this can only be comprehensive if they are broadened to include techniques and therapies not currently part of the formal medical service . a holistic approach would ensure the most appropriate therapy in each case . great savings are possible . for example , integrated medicine in britain in conjunction with a leading teaching hospital has pioneered the use of marma therapy in the rehabilitation of stroke victims , which has been found to save on average about hk $500,000 per patient . multiply that by the number of elderly stroke victims in hong kong and the potential savings become staggering . as another example , the health administration of ottawa has conducted a study on the management of lower back pain in canada , which is of course prevalent in old people , and has concluded that if lower back pain was managed by doctors of chiropractic - i stress " managed " , not necessarily " treated " , as i have been misquoted on this - the saving to the canadian economy could be c $2 billion per year . i would therefore recommend that the plan should include provision for a comprehensive study of alternative techniques and therapies so that a holistic and integrated approach to care for the elderly can be adopted expeditiously in hong kong . fourthly , quality assurance . quality assurance means the assurance that the elderly will be satisfied with the care they get . quality assurance refers to the end product - user satisfaction . for example , studies have shown that in some circumstances in hong kong , patients prefer traditional chinese medicine to western medicine in the first instance . the plan should take this into account when providing guidance to those responsible for elderly care . furthermore , elderly people will not be satisfied with misdiagnosis or iatrogenic illness , so these weaknesses need to be quantified and minimized with inevitably large savings in cost . in conclusion , madam deputy , i urge that the plan be truly comprehensive and that maximum use be made of cost savings through efficient management to produce the most effective care for the elderly . with these remarks , i support the motion . dr lam kui - chun : madam deputy , in his motion , the honourable fred li has mentioned " health care plan for the elderly " . his choice of words has aroused deep concern among doctors who are at present participating in the school medical scheme , as the scheme is considered by doctors , students and parents to be a complete failure . although the doctors concerned and the government have agreed in as early as 1992 to abandon this " tasteless " scheme , unfortunately , it still lingers on feebly . while this issue has hardly been settled , mr li puts forth another issue , that is , " a comprehensive health care plan for the elderly " . the doctors concerned fear that the health care plan for the elderly will drag them into another never - ending nightmare just as what they have experienced with the school medical scheme . if the motion moved by mr li will become an elderly version of the school medical scheme , it will not have the support of the doctors concerned . neither will it have the support from parents whose children have participated in the scheme . the liberal party will also oppose the proposal . the honourable fred li has stated that the motion actually concerns preventive medical care services . insofar as such services are concerned , a task group chaired by me has been set up under the st james settlement in wan chai providing services of this sort for more than 6 years . the task group consists of members from a diversity of professions , ( including doctors , social workers , lecturers and general staff of universities , nurses , dietitians , and so on ) . we have conducted a research to compare different factors in a scientific way . the results of this objective research confirm that preventive health care services are beneficial to the health of the elderly and that medical expenditure can also be reduced in the long run . detailed information relating to the research was released 3 years ago . as regards the mode of service currently adopted by the government at the service centre for the elderly at nam shan estate , our comments and justifications are as follows : 1 . it is too late to begin prevention of geriatric illnesses at the age of 65 . geriatric illnesses feature senility , which generally starts developing when a person is in his middle age and attacks a person 20 or 30 years later . the degenerated tissues are not mendable medically . from our experience in the past 6 years , half of the patients who suffered from geriatric illnesses died before reaching the age of 60 . therefore , whether prevention against geriatric illnesses starts at the age of 65 or 60 , it is still too late . it will only be a waste of public funds if the health of the elderly cannot be protected . we suggest that prevention against senility brought by geriatric illnesses ought to commence at the age of 45 . 2. as blood test is not included in the physical examination provided by the clinic at nam shan estate , the elderly are not effectively protected against the two major killer diseases , namely stroke and cardiac diseases . it is because these two diseases are brought about by arteriosclerosis , of which one of the major causes is excessive cholesterol or triglyceride . our experience at st james settlement is that about one fifth of the people in hong kong carry in their blood an excessively high level of either of these two components , which can only be detected by blood test . therefore , we suggest the government to conduct blood tests for cholesterol and triglyceride at the geriatric clinics . in so doing , the incidence of stroke and cardiac diseases can be effectively prevented . 3. according to the definition of " total health " , the mental state of the elderly is also a criterion to determine whether the elderly can be regarded as healthy . at present , the problem of suicide among old people is still serious . last year , the total number of people died of suicide was 609 , of which over one third , that is , 221 , were over 60 . besides , the suicide rate among males aged between 55 and 59 was more than double of the average suicide rate of the community . from what we have learned at st james settlement , 30% of the service recipients who appear to be normal have psychological problems . 3% of them have to receive formal psychological counselling . therefore , we suggest that psychological health examination should be provided at the clinic at nam shan estate . 4. the citizens should have the freedom to choose which doctor to see when they are sick and the government should respect this right . for patients who have been found to suffer from some kind of latent illnesses , they may be referred to government hospitals for further treatment , but under general circumstances , they should not be forced to go to designated clinics . copies of the examination reports should be provided to patients so that they may choose their own doctor for consultation . 5. lastly , the implementation of any preventive health care measures must be backed up by a comprehensive health care education program . as regards the proposal , as embodied in mr li 's motion , to speed up the implementation of a health care plan and have it conducted on a wider basis , i have urged the government time and again during the past two years to implement such a scheme earnestly . however , i have to make it clear that the liberal party only supports the provision of preventive medical examination by the government . if the proposed medical and health care plan will jeopardize our existing system which allows the co-existence of both public and private medical care services and cause hong kong to be caught in a plight in which medical services are run either by the government alone or by the private sector alone , as in the case of north america and australia , the liberal party will object to such a plan . the intention of the motion , that is to provide health care for the elderly on a wider basis , is warmly welcomed . yet , we have reservations about the wordings of the motion which fails to define clearly whether the nature of the so - called health care plan is purely preventive . this might render the health care plan into an elderly version of the school medical scheme . this is not the wishes of the elderly , their families , the doctors concerned and the liberal party . based on what i have explicitly stated , the liberal party supports the intention of the motion which calls for the prevention of geriatric illnesses , but we do not support any possible implication in the motion of providing treatment in the health care plan in future . as for the honourable tam yiu - chung 's amendment , which attaches social services to the question of health care , the liberal party supports the underlying spirit but does not agree that elderly aged 60 should be eligible to receive social welfare services . madam deputy , these are my remarks . dr huang chen - ya : madam deputy , the motion i proposed on 2 november 1994 was carried in this council . the motion urges the government to draw up a medical policy based on disease prevention and to set out specific objectives to strengthen primary health care services at low costs , especially in regard to the prevention of heart disease , cerebrovascular disease , cancer and aids , in order to promote public health . as we all know , heart disease , cerebrovascular disease and cancer are the top three killer diseases in hong kong , and the the incidence of such diseases increases proportionately with age . therefore , a genuinely prevention - based medical policy must focus on the prevention of heart disease , strokes and cancer of the elderly . on 2 november , government expressed support for a medical policy based on disease prevention . regrettably , the government has said one thing , but has done quite another . in its follow - up report given a few days ago , the government said that only two elderly health care centres will be commissioned between 1995 and 1996 . since there are over 700 000 elderly people aged 60 or above in hong kong , this actually means that only one out of 70 elderly people will be lucky enough to enjoy the services provided by elderly health care centres . the prevention - based medical policy in question really exists in name only , in the literal sense . therefore , i hereby urge the government to take concrete actions to implement a prevention - based medical policy . however , the problems involved are not related to any shortage of resources , contrary to what mr tam has said . both the government and mr tam may have failed to understand that looking after the health of the elderly requires a more comprehensive , district - based health care plan . elderly people 's difficulties in getting about , coupled with their often tight finances , have rendered it difficult for them to travel long distances . the government has attempted to concentrate health care services in large centres , in the hope that elderly people from different places can go there themselves for the services they need . this is obviously not a well - thought - out approach . convenient access and low charges are the two pre-requisites to the successful provision of elderly health care services . hence , the government should set up at least one health care centre in each of the 18 administrative districts . such health care centres can serve three purposes . first , they can provide the elderly with general check - ups and health care education . second , they can serve as second - stage centres for health examination . a health care centre should provide services only to the elderly living in its vicinity . because of this , it is all the more necessary for us to establish a well - distributed network of health care centres . this can be achieved by involving voluntary organisations and private medical practitioners . in this way , each and every elderly person can gain access to check - up services near to his or her own home in the absence of any company , and without having to travel long distances . apart from physical check - ups , monitoring of illnesses is also very important . many elderly people are in need of regular medication because of health problems . but , many patients suffering from serious but common diseases , such as hypertension and diabetes have to wait for several months before their turn for follow - ups . as a result , their conditions have often deteriorated beyond controllable limits , sometimes even without being noticed by others until their health is severely damaged . the government should provide resources to enable the elderly to have blood pressure measurements and diabetes tests in nearby elderly centres or private clinics , so that their health conditions can be monitored . in case a disease gets out of control , early remedies can be sought . in this way , the rationale behind the saying that " remedies should be sought at the early stage of a disease " can be put into practice , thus reducing the elderly 's demand for hospitalization . if the check - ups conducted by neighborhood elderly health care centres and private clinics reveal that an elderly person has contracted a disease , he or she can be referred to a proper medical institution for treatment . however , sometimes , it may be that only suspicious symptoms calling for further examination are detected . in this case , if the elderly person concerned is simply referred to an ordinary government clinic where he or she has to wait together with other patients , unnecessary " queuing " will result . therefore , another kind of clinics specializing in providing further check - up services should be set up . health care centres can provide this kind of further check - up services in each of the districts . the third function of a health care centre is to collect statistics from its own district for the purpose of co-ordinating elderly health care services at district level . it can also serve as a base for specialized services and elderly health care outreaching teams . the provision of elderly health care services is not the monopoly of medical professionals such as doctors and nurses . depression and other mental diseases are often the results of loneliness and social isolation . hence , in order to prevent elderly people from committing suicide and contracting mental diseases , we have to satisfy their mental and community needs . accidental falls is another common problem among elderly people . their ability to keep their balance decreases as they become older . this , coupled with degenerating eyesight , makes them more susceptible to tripping over obstacles and fall . because of this , if the floors , staircases , handrails , furniture and lighting in the homes of the elderly can be improved , accidents can be reduced . many accidents can in fact be avoided if out - reaching teams comprising social workers , health care workers , occupational therapists and so on are available to help the elderly at district level . the government should draw up a comprehensive policy for looking after the elderly . the implementation of such a policy should involve the co - ordinated efforts of various kinds of professionals . mr michael ho : madam deputy , health care and medical care are actually two different concepts ; health care may include medical care , but we should not focus our attention entirely on medical care . from the angle of primary health care , if we say that a person is not ill , it does not necessarily mean that he is healthy . primary medical care , that is , treatment of diseases , is only part of primary health care services . primary health care services care about the health of every person . the scope is wide , covering cleanliness of our potable water , refuse and sewage disposal , mental stress , living environment and so on . members have just discussed a lot about physical health care ; they have also talked about mental and other health care . in physical health care , we have focussed on treatment . i do not object to more connections , or even co-ordination , between the government and the private medical services , to improve the medical services for the elderly as soon as possible . in this regard , the greatest advantage is that we can very soon provide more medical services . however , we have to learn from the failure of the school medical scheme in the past . the department of health is developing in the right direction . it provides genuine primary health care services at low cost but with good effects . the genuine health care services include physical examination , health education , psychological counseling , food hygiene and so on . the only drawback is that the seven health centres proposed by the government are not enough . in respect of these seven health centres , we have not yet worked out any specific plan to estimate the supply with reference to the demand on the basis of the population , the needs of the elderly and the types of primary health care service we are going to provide . i would like to extend the scope by discussing health care for the elderly from the angle of primary health care . during the discussions we just now had , a lot of diseases such as stroke and hypertension were mentioned . it is quite true that with annual physical examination , early detection and early treatment of these diseases are possible . we also have to take care of psychological health , such as the provision of psychological counselling , as mentioned by some colleagues . in an even broader perspective , i shall discuss other primary health care services . the quality of our potable water is good and our living environment is not bad . but how about the living environment of many elderly people ? this goes beyond the scope of authority of the secretary for health and welfare . unfortunately , the chief secretary is not here , but the financial secretary is present . we hope that the other primary health care services would also be taken into account , which apparently include the living environment , housing and the income of the elderly . this is to say , if an elderly person does not have money , he will naturally have mental pressure . i hope that , first of all , the government will not back out of its proposal to increase old age allowance for the elderly . if elderly people do not have money , they will have to beg on the streets , collect aluminium cans and paper cartons , and live in caged apartments . they naturally have great psychological pressure , how can they possibly remain healthy ? under such psychological pressure , psychological counselling , will actually have no effect and even annual physical examinations cannot really safeguard their health . there is a joke within our profession . a doctor once advised a patient who lived in a poor environment : " you need fresh air , so do not live in a cage any longer . you had better move to shouson hill road and live there ! " can this be done by just saying so ? if not , we have to care about the basic income and the living environment of the elderly people . the real concept of health care should refer not only to treatment of diseases and the preventive measures we have described just now . it should be a step further and we should start from primary health care services in improving the elderly people 's living and working environment , so that they may have enough nutrition and of course , have enough money to buy nourishing food . if we only talk about treatment of diseases and physical check - ups , i will say that these are no more than empty words . we may promote health education and make elderly people understand that they need fresh air and that they should not live in cages , but actually they are not even able to live in public housing . how can they have a better living environment ? if they do not have good diets , how can we ensure that they have good health ? does it mean that if they go to health centres to see the dietitians for advice , they will be able to follow the advice ? i hope our discussion today will not become empty talks . i really hope that we can do something in respect of health care for the elderly . this task goes beyond the scope of the work of the health and welfare branch . i hope that the government can take up the overall co-ordination of the work , for the sake of the elderly in hong kong , and to enable them to enjoy good health . madam deputy , these are my remarks . the president resumed the chair . mr wong wai - yin : mr president , the lunar new year is now approaching . for elderly people , i think the best well wishing greetings are " vitality to be associated with old age " and " strong and sturdy " . but if we do not have a proper health care programme under which the elderly 's health is properly looked after , thus negating the need to rely on expensive hospital services on long - term basis , then such greetings are but castles in the air . according to information provided by the department of health , the government 's total expenditure on medical services in 1993-94 was $1.45 billion , and the estimated expenditure for 1994-54 is $1.71 billion . in fact , the elderly people 's demand on government medical services has all along been tremendous . at present , a monthly average of about 134 000 people aged 60 or above , representing 42% of the total patients , patronize the government general out - patient clinics , and elderly people account for 21% of patients using the specialist out - patient clinic services of the hospital authority . as regards hospital services , elderly people account for 37.5% of the occupation of public hospital beds in terms of the average number of days . all these show the extent to which elderly people rely on medical services . mr president , just now in his speech , the honourable fred li has repeatedly stressed that our proposals are very cost - effective . in the long run , it will also help to relieve the government 's current heavy medical expenditure . in particular , we have adopted the example of the nam shan elderly health centre for our calculations . at present , the annual membership fee for the nam shan elderly health centre is $220 per person , with all other expenditure and income taken care of by the department of health . the annual expenditure estimate is about $2.05 million . if 10% of the 3 000 members admitted by the centre are fee - exempted comprehensive social security assistance ( cssa ) recipients , the centre 's annual income would be about $600,000 . so the subsidy by the department of health would only be about $1.5 million a year . if we are to provide one elderly health centre in every administrative district of hong kong , the government 's annual expenditure would amount to about $27 million . suppose we have participation from private medical practitioners and suppose the membership fee for each elderly person is maintained at $220 a year , with the government paying the private medical practitioner $100 for every participant , then even if all the 700 000 elderly people in hong kong who are aged 60 or above take part in this health care programme , with 10% of them being cssa recipients , the annual subsidy to be provided by the government will only be $90 million . of course , full implementation of the programme will require the government to improve the staffing of social workers and administrators for each centre , which will cost about $8.5 million . it is initially estimated that the total commitment by the government will be about $125 million a year if it is to implement the programme in full . comparing with the present $1.7 billion spent annually on hospital services for the elderly , the financial commitment required on the government is really very small . in addition , this plan will help to reduce the elderly 's demand for institutional care , thereby cutting government expenditure on hospital services . it is thus quite cost - effective . mr president , i would now like to explain the community - based service concept . in fact , the concept of community - based health care services for the elderly was clearly established as early as december 1990 when the report of the working party on primary health care was published . indeed , this concept is formed with reference to the experience of some other countries similarly facing the problem of an aging population . for example , singapore has established in 1995 a health services for the elderly department within its primary health division under the ministry of health for the implementation of community - based health services for the elderly . according to the report of the working party on primary health care , the most important objective for community health services for the elderly is " to provide and promote community - based non-institutional health care services for the elderly including the development of health maintenance and health promotion programmes with a view to preventing or deferring the need for long - term institutional care . " therefore , our proposals are essentially based on the principle set out in the report with further development and consolidation of community - based health services for the elderly . mr president , the honourable fred li 's motion seeks to benefit every elderly person who is 60 years of age or above , including of course those elderly people who have difficulty in mobility . mr fred li has just detailed six specific proposals . these cover not only elderly people who have mobility problems , but also those who are cssa recipients and those who live alone . besides , we propose that at least one elderly health centre be set up in every district , hoping that all the elderly people will be able to use the services of the health care centre situated in their district . the proposed reinforcement to the outreaching medical service for the elderly is geared to providing a visiting health care service for those who have great mobility problems or for those who are invalids . as the saying goes , " prevention is better than cure " . i sincerely hope that the government will positively consider the motion of mr fred li , a democratic party member , and implement the proposals to provide better health care for the elderly . with these remarks , mr president , i support the motion . president : mr fred li , do you wish to speak ? you have five minutes to speak on the amendment . mr fred li : mr president , i have listened attentively to the details of mr tam 's amendment . his amendment basically supplements my original motion and has little effect on it . in essence , mr tam 's amendment aims to ensure that the government can provide adequate resources . i think this should be included in all motions aimed at urging the government to take any required actions . we should all know that sufficient resources are a prerequisite for the provision of public services . the aim of my original motion is to focus on health care only , not anything else . if we are to include welfare services for the elderly , we will have a lot to deal with . for instance , we have only two outreaching teams . elderly centres now receive only an 80% subsidy . they should get full subvention . besides , the suicide rate of the elderly is also a concern of this council . all these points to the necessity of more government efforts in the area of welfare services , especially counselling . however , it is my hope that our motion debate today can have a sharper focus , concentrating first on the government 's elderly health centre , and later extending the scope in the hope that better services can be provided . in motion debates , as in the case of other matters dealt with in this council , an amendment will always be moved to narrow down a motion which is relatively broad in scope , and vice versa . now , mr tam has moved an amendment seeking to broaden the scope of my motion . thinking that the scope of my motion is not wide enough , he mentioned the high suicide rate of the elderly . fearing that the government might encounter problems in setting up 18 privately - run health centres , he has gone so far as to dismiss my idea as unrealistic . actually , i have distributed a more detailed information paper to all members . i wonder if mr tam has read it . this paper has addressed all his worries . i have conducted my own studies , and have also discussed the issue with mrs fok . i have also visited the centre in nam shan estate and held discussion with the doctors there . the motion represents not only my own opinions because we have a whole team working on it . i hope that the motion today can focus on this point and that the government will find it impossible to resist such a positive and constructive proposal . this proposal is in fact based on one of the government 's own services which we want to further improve and extend to all the 18 administrative districts . as mentioned by the honourable wong wai - yin just now , the government expenditure to be incurred as a result of this proposal will only be $125 million at the most . this will already be the maximum because we have made allowance for all the 700 000 elderly people to participate in the plan . thus calculated , the costs will involve a mere sum of $125 million , which can in no way compare with the costs of hospitalization of the elderly , which is over $1700 million . apart from this , i would like to draw your attention to two other figures . first , 41% of the patients who visit the 59 out - patient clinics under the department of health in a month are aged 60 or above . second , during the past seven months , over 30% of the patients admitted by hospitals under the hospital authority are aged 60 or above . these figures show that a large proportion of our resources for medical services has been used to cater for the needs of the elderly people . such a burden will be reduced if quality preventive health care services are provided . i believe that this principle will be supported by all of us . so , i hope that the motion today can focus on this point . we have also given deliberation to mr tam 's amendment . the democratic party cannot refuse to support his amendment because we also consider his suggestions constructive . therefore , we support his amendment . with regard to the initial amendment of dr the honourable leong che - hung , it was moved largely due to his worry about the implications of the word " medical " . a mere mention of the word " medical " in the original motion seems to have scared many members in this council , who dread to see a repetition of the school medical scheme fiasco . since quite a number of members have just now cautioned against this , i must reiterate that we do not have the slightest intention of following the example of the school medical scheme . the health care plan in question involves only diease prevention and has nothing whatoever to do with medical treatment , which does not fall within the scope of my motion . so , dr leong , you can rest assured . these are my remarks . secretary for health and welfare : mr president , first of all , i must thank the honourable fred li , the honourable tam yiu - chung and other members who have spoken during this debate for their diverse views and stimulating ideas on this very important subject of health care for the elderly . caring for our elderly has always been a government priority . this has been abundantly proven in various policy areas such as housing , welfare , and health care . we have in place extensive programmes to promote the health and welfare of our elderly men and women . the working group on care for the elderly which reported in august last year made 71 recommendations that carry significant and far - reaching implications on the provision of services for our elderly citizens in the years to come . we will implement the recommendations contained in this report at an annual recurrent cost of $37 million in 1995-96 , rising to $108 million in 1999-2000 . another $327 million in capital cost will also be spent between 1995 and 2000 in improving services for our elderly people . this is a clear commitment by the government . primary health care the report of the working party on primary health care ( phc ) which was published in 1990 reaffirmed the government 's commitment towards primary health care and its important role in the overall health care programme for our citizens . it also set the scene for re-orientation of emphasis towards primary health care in our overall health care policy . in this process , we have followed several guiding principles : ( a ) although the application of primary health care varies between population groups , there should not be an arbitrary segregation of different age groups in health promotion . we agree with dr the honourable leong che - hung who rightly pointed out that health promotion should start at an early age ; ( b ) a multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted approach should be adopted in the provision of services . this means that primary health care should be provided not just through the government or through the medical profession alone , but also through the non-medical disciplines , such as welfare workers . many members have also spoken on this topic . the modes of provision of primary health care should include not just health screening but also disease prevention , counselling , health education , curative treatment and rehabilitative care . we need to maximize the use of all existing resources , not just in the health department but in all government - funded health care institutions such as the hospital authority ( ha ) and other subvented non - governmental organizations ; ( c ) intersectoral collaboration between the public and private sectors should be encouraged . in hong kong , there is a very vigorous private health sector providing choice and quality of service to our citizens . in primary health care as in other aspects of the health care services , the government should play a co-ordinating and enabling role in promoting collaboration between the public and private sectors in providing a comprehensive network of health care services for the community ; ( d ) the success of any health care programme depends to a great extent on participation by the community and the individual . every person has a role to play in ensuring his own health and in promoting the health of others . what the government can do is to raise the awareness of the importance of good health through community education and disease prevention programmes . but at the end of the day , the role of each individual and the family in health care and promotion is extremely important . elderly as a target group these guiding principles of primary health care have been applied at the policy level , the organizational level and the operational level . in the four years following the report on primary health care , we have not only initiated new ventures targeting the elderly as a group , but have also encouraged a realization of partnership and the team approach in health care for this vulnerable group . at the policy level , we have recently put in place a new division called the elderly services division within the health and welfare branch comprising staff of different disciplines including health and welfare . among other things , this division will co-ordinate and oversee policy matters related to health services for elderly people . it will introduce a multi-disciplinary approach to this important work . but to succeed , we need everyone 's support . at the organizational level , the department of health continues to take the lead in collaborating with other health care providers to care for elderly people in the community through its network of general out - patient clinics and the new elderly health centres . at the same time , the ha , in its effort to initiate a seamless health care system for all , including elderly people , has extended its services outside the boundaries of the hospital so as to reach out and mobilize community support for elderly people at risk of hospitalization . new initiatives include the community - based geriatric assessment teams and clinics as well as community psychogeriatric teams to provide a more structured approach in the provision of outreach medical services and support for welfare institutions . at the operational level , we are working towards a close but managed interface between health care personnel from different disciplines and sectors . furthermore , the growing degree of community involvement is most encouraging . for instance , at the nam shan elderly health centre , we organize self-help support groups for elderly citizens with similar health concerns to promote the basic ingredients of healthy living . an example is the promotion of exercise and the balanced diet . through counselling and group activities , participants are informed of the basis of health risks and disease causation as well as equipped with the necessary skills and support to resist social pressure to conform to unhealthy living . to ensure continuity of care for discharged elderly patients , close collaboration with carers assumes prime importance . for instance , the community - based geriatric assessment teams within the ha carry out visits to offer specialist advice and educational programmes for lay carers and care - givers in residential care homes . another major initiative to foster community participation is the development of volunteer services in ha hospitals through which volunteers acquire an understanding of health as they offer their services to those in need . we will support the ha 's initiatives in channelling its resources and efforts with other health care providers into the community to create an effective network of preventive health care programmes , particularly for the elderly . the organization of health educational programmes and health checks in social centres for the elderly operated by non-governmental organizations is another vivid demonstration of intersectoral co-operation and community partnership in health . in these programmes , voluntary medical personnel are invited to give health talks and carry out simple health checks for elderly clients . they also train up staff of the social centre so that they can provide the same service to users . these projects and other health promotional activities initiated by different health care sectors have benefited many of our elderly citizens . it is our intention that these activities should continue to flourish to cater for the varying needs of our elderly people . need to try out different health care models in developing different models on health care for the elderly , we must not fall into the trap of using only one model to the exclusion of other health promotion options . the seven elderly health centres which are specifically targeting healthy individuals aged 65 and above serve as an experimental model for identifying a cost - effective operational mode . it is a new , publicly funded service providing a venue where preventive health care programmes are conducted for older members of our community . the first elderly health centre commenced operation in may 1994 and is welcome by all who have used its services . the second and third centres will be operational in 1995- 96 . the other centres are in the pipeline . these centres will serve the important purpose of developing and fine - tuning protocol and logistics of preventive and promotive services in an out - patient setting . the intention is to accumulate working experience so that future centres will be successfully integrated in our out - patient clinics ( gopc ) on a territory - wide basis . concern has been raised by the honourable fred li about dental services for elderly people . the government 's policy on dental service is to provide preventive and promotive services to the general public , and curative service to persons in need of emergency treatment , to specified groups , and to in - patients in public hospitals whose dental treatment forms an essential part of their medical treatment . for elderly people who are comprehensive social security assistance recipients , special grants are in place to provide financial assistance for their dental treatments in designated dental clinics and clinics run by non-governmental organizations and non - profit - making bodies . health screening the points raised by the honourable fred li and other members about increasing the accessibility of service venues , improving the co-ordination among service providers , providing integrated care , promoting intersectoral collaboration and enhancing community participation are well taken , and deserve our support . the issue of health screening is a complex subject and i wish to sound a word of caution . as far as i am aware , population screening of the scale proposed by some members has not been practised in other countries . health screening programmes should as a rule be based on cost - benefit analysis . one must bear in mind that screening is very much part and parcel of clinical practice . for example , taking of blood pressure and routine urine examinations constitute some form of informal screening . most elderly persons have access to regular health care services , either in the public or private sector . screening for people presenting themselves to health care services is recognized by the health care professionals to be the most effective and practicable way of identifying people at risk . it would also make the best use of existing resources . similarly , the working party on primary health care advocated the introduction of screening for people aged 65 and above attending general out - patient clinics . the planned integration of elderly health centres into all our general out - patient clinics is clearly in line with this recommendation . future efforts the concept of primary health care has taken root in our formulation of health care policy . as always , we will work to ensure that no one will be denied access to health care services through a lack of means . as i pointed out earlier , we will also work to better co-ordinate and facilitate the growing collaboration of all our health care professionals . we have a sound health care system that cares for all age groups , but we need to refine our services to cater to specific groups , in this case , the older members of the community . existing services will be critically evaluated to ensure the most cost - effective use of all existing resources . innovative ideas originating from the public and private sectors will be encouraged and tried out . last but not least , we will motivate the community in different ways to help the individual and his family adopt a healthy lifestyle so that the community , as it grows old together , will do so in good health . thank you , mr president . question on mr tam yiu - chung 's amendment put and agreed to . president : mr fred li , you are now entitled to reply and you have four minutes 10 seconds out of your original 15 minutes . mr fred li : mr president , i will be brief . first of all , i would like to thank the 11 members who have kindly spoken on such a platitudinous issue . in fact , i feel quite disappointed at the reply given by the secretary for health and welfare because she was only repeating the undertakings already made in the report of the working group on care for the elderly . most of the 11 members who spoke today criticized the slow progress of the seven health centres for the elderly . only one health centre is now in operation ; another two are expected to commence operation between 1995 and 1996 while the other four are still under planning . the secretary has failed to respond seriously to this point . besides , i would like to add that participation of private medical practitioners should be further studied as a possibility . as for dental services , it must be reiterated that the government is actually not providing any dental services for the public because out - patient dental services are provided for civil servants only . the elderly , about whom we are concerned , are barred from such services . many senior citizens have reflected to us their concern about the availability of dental treatment and examination to them . basically , they rely entirely on private dental services at present . this is most unsatisfactory . i hope that the health and welfare branch can take heed of the opinions of the elderly . today , a lot of elderly people are voicing their opinions outside the legislative council chamber . i collected 5 500 signatures and have handed them to mrs katherine fok . these signatures represent the opinions of the public regarding the health care services provided for the elderly . lastly , i hope that the seven health centres for the elderly will be completed as soon as possible . i also think that the provision of health centres for the elderly should not remain at the the pilot stage . instead , similar services as provided by the seven health centres should be extended to every administrative district , so as to save the elderly the trouble of travelling to and from these centres for such invaluable services . the saying that " prevention is better than cure " is incontestable , i believe . it is hoped that the secretary for health and welfare will put this concept into practice . thank you , mr president . question on mr fred li 's motion as amended by mr tam yiu - chung put and agreed to . withdrawal of the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 ms anna wu moved the following motion : " that this council reproves the government for withdrawing the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 after amendment to the bill moved by the honourable lau chin - shek was carried in the legislative council , and urges the government to pledge its respect for the legislative council as a decision - making authority on legislative matters , including the making of amendments to bills , in order to maintain the public 's confidence in the legislative council and the democratic system . " ms anna wu : mr president , i move the motion standing in my name on the order paper . nothing is more damaging to the democratic process than to have a government seeking to bully a legislature into submission . mr lau chin - shek resigned to protest against the government 's withdrawal of the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 ( the bill ) after his amendments to the bill were carried in the legislative council . these amendments sought to improve the government package on benefits for employees . the attempt to frustrate legislators ' efforts occurred not just once but twice with the bill . on the first occasion , the government decided not to proceed with the last reading of the bill after mr lau succeeded in securing a majority for his amendments . the amended bill was ultimately lost by one vote , but the message given by the government was clear - the government did not wish to have the amendments passed and would not take responsibility for it . months later , the government presented a second bill . this time , mr lau 's success was met by an even more extreme measure - the withdrawal of the bill itself by the government . the government could have adjourned the bill , but it did not . the government evidently feared that mr lau might also have majority support for his amendments at the third reading , as well . with one stone , the government killed three birds : it warned the public not to make too many demands ; it damaged the effectiveness of the legislature ; and , it saved the governor the embarrassment of having to withhold assent from a bill passed by the legislature . the withdrawal of the bill presented a naked disregard of the democratic process - it scuttled a bill successfully amended by the legislative council . the government was flexing its muscles , in effect saying to the legislature and to the public , " if you dare to ask for more than i am willing to give , then you shall not have anything at all . " if anybody should ask for a full bowl of rice instead of the half - bowl offered by the government , then that half - bowl too will be taken away . such tactic is a blatant attempt to circumscribe the constitutional role of the legislature to legislate by limiting what the legislature can propose through amendments . this is a hostage - taking stratagem intended by the executive to intimidate . what this means is that , despite paying lip service to the democratic process , the government does not consider itself bound to respect the majority view of the legislative council . the principal function of the legislative council is to express the views of the public , which the council represents . a government that is permanent and unelected - if it really aspires to be accountable - must pay close attention to the sentiments expressed by the council . the council has in recent years , through the democratic process , become the most representative legislature the territory has ever seen . when the government thwarts the will of this chamber , it thwarts the public will . this chamber has the authority and the legitimacy to call the government to account . the letters patent ( article vii (1) ) provides that : " the governor , by and with the advice and consent of the legislative council , may make laws for the peace , order and good government of the colony . " this formula appears in the preamble of every ordinance . the line following the long title of the ordinance reads : " enacted by the governor of hong kong , with the advice and consent of the legislative council thereof . " it is because the government is unelected that it is vital that it governs with the advice and consent of the legislative council . for the administration to ignore , to frustrate and to intimidate the legislature is for it to undermine the constitutional role played by the legislative council . the governor is on record as saying that the legislative council is not a rubber stamp " and will not become a rubber stamp " . these are fine words . but his actions and those of his administration indicate otherwise . the actions indicate that both he and his administration expect the legislative council to be little more than a " rubber stamp " . the chief secretary , in her response to the criticism , said on 26 october 1994 : " it is no secret that the administration believes in executive - led government . but this council nevertheless has great powers , and makes use of them . members can , and do , amend , or even reject , the administration 's legislative proposals ..... the administration does not always like it when you exercise these powers of the legislature . and we reserve the right not always to agree with your views , just as you reserve the right not always to agree with ours . " the most effective way of checking government conduct - and misconduct - is to use the legislative powers conferred upon the legislative council . scrutinizing and amending bills are part and parcel of the work of any legislature . even the chief secretary said this was acceptable . unfortunately , words and actions do not always match . in other parts of the world , elected representatives play a part - the dominant part - in setting legislative and funding priorities . the hong kong administration must bear in mind the differences between the constitutional framework of hong kong and that of the united kingdom . in the united kingdom , a government 's decision to prevent consideration of an important bill or amendment can ultimately be overcome by a public vote removing the government from power . here , as the administration well knows , this is not possible . there is even more reason , therefore , for the administration to heed the advice of the legislature . the executive is accountable to the legislature . i hope the chief secretary was not suggesting that being accountable meant no more than agreeing to disagree . such an approach would be a sure recipe for deadlock and disintegration , if not disaster . such an attitude reflects the mentality of a government that considers itself unimpeachable and , ultimately , unaccountable . even the chief secretary must agree that this is not what an executive - led government should mean . this debate is not about disturbing the constitutional formulae for hong kong but about how best to respect and observe that constitutional relationship between the executive and the legislature . the governor in his last policy address to the legislative council declared : " the administration proposes and the legislative council disposes . " in practice , however , what the administration shows is that , when the legislative council proposes an amendment , it is the administration that disposes by refusing to act . this debate is not about whether or not the government should have the power to withdraw a bill . indeed , the standing orders of the council provide the government with the power to do that . it is not my proposal to do away with that power . this would be constitutionally undesirable as there are clear situations when this power need to be preserved , such as , when there is a clear mistake . this debate is about how that power should be exercised . the way the government chose to use those powers in the case of the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 was capricious and arbitrary . the difference between the government 's package and mr lau 's amendments was very narrow and indeed , to the credit of some business leaders in the council , they were in favour of the amendments . given the government 's handling of the bill , it would be prudent and desirable for the council to consider ways and means to reduce the possibility of the repetition of such incidents . there is thus a need to review procedural safeguards . one possibility is to provide additional flexibility for a member to step in immediately and move by way of a private member 's bill at the same sitting upon the government withdrawing a bill . such a procedure need not disturb the current technical limitations requiring government consent on bills that entail government funding . notice , formalities and gazettal can be dispensed with ; after all , members would already have considered the bill . somewhere a balance must be struck and procedural disincentives built in to discourage the government from using its powers to ride roughshod over the legislature . mr president , in a wider context i would renew my call to review the longer term resource requirements for the legislative council . the funding for the legislative council is approved by the government . while it may not be politically wise to call for a power for the legislative council to vote in its own budget , it would be desirable for a mechanism to be agreed upon so that the legislative council would not be held hostage by the executive . in conclusion , let me point out again that in hong kong , the government is unelected , and neither arises from the legislature , nor falls by its will . it has the power to withhold bills from the legislative agenda indefinitely . legislators are wholly excluded from policy formulation , a process that is conducted behind closed doors by an executive exclusively made up of unelected civil servants . public input is sought not through the active participation of elected officials in designing policy , but through consultation , that is , only to the extent the executive asked for it , and only on the basis of the information it chooses to release . the resulting policies are then put before the legislative council on what the government now apparently sees as a " take - it - or - leave - it " basis , at least where important matters are concerned . in this constitutional context , the government should take special care to respect the legislative council 's opinions at the only stage where it does participate . as a matter of principle , it should pay greater attention to legislative sentiments as expressed in motion debates , and take a more permissive line on private members ' bills . instead , stratagems like the withdrawal of a bill to prevent its amendment by the legislative council undermine the legislature 's acknowledged power to amend . it would be ironic if , after battling to upgrade the legislative council 's representation , this governor then presided over the administration that crippled the council 's effectiveness by a determined refusal to take account of its views . thank you , mr president . i move the motion . question on the motion proposed . mr allen lee : mr president , 14 december 1994 is a day that should be remembered by all the people of hong kong and the legislative council , because on that day , an extremely regrettable event took place at the meeting of this council . first it is regrettable that the proposal reached by the labour advisory board ( lab ) after detailed discussions was not given due respect . the lab comprises representatives from both employers and employees as well as government officials . under the representative government of hong kong , the administration 's purpose of setting advisory committees is to gather the most brilliant ideas through consultation and these ideas will form the basis for decision - making . therefore , the administration itself should , first of all , respect the efforts made by the lab so that the recommendations put forward by the lab may be integrated into its policies . when i said " respect " , i refer not only to the formulation of a bill on the basis of the lab 's proposals accepted by the administration . i also mean that the administration has the responsibility to try its best to explain to this council the significance of the bill itself and how it may affect the interests of hong kong as a whole . the administration also has a responsibility to lobby members so as to gain their support . in such a way , the efforts of the lab and various government departments will not be in vain . as for the case in question , instead of trying its best to gain support for the bill , the administration has chosen to act impulsively . it withdrew the bill abruptly before the third reading . this was extremely regrettable . furthermore , an equally disturbing phenomenon is that , government officials as well as some of the members of this council failed to control their emotions . i am sure that at a time when objectivity , pragmatism and rationality are badly needed , such emotional behaviours have tarnished the image of both the administration and the legislative council . such emotional behaviours have also brought about unnecessary barriers to the enactment and enforcement of laws which have far - reaching implications on the public . at this very moment when it is already the latter half of the transitional period , we should be on the alert for this situation . mr president , we may have plenty of ideals , but we must not lose sight of the overall situation . we should not sacrifice the stability of hong kong and the intersts of hong kong people for our personal ideals . hong kong has , and will have , an executive - led system . the liberal party is deeply convinced that only under an executive - led system will hong kong have stability and prosperity . we should appeal to the general public to assess the case in question rationally and not to be misled into believing that the system which we have been practising so far and which has proved effective must be overthrown in order for hong kong to have a better future . some people outside this council have a misunderstanding . they think that supporting today 's motion is equivalent to not supporting or not respecting the consensus reached by the lab . i must take this opportunity to clarify . the liberal party has always supported and respected the consensus of the lab because it has synthesized the most valuable ideas of the employees and the employer . what we are dissatisfied with is the way the administration has handled the matter . that is why we want to reprove the administration . we think that the administration should be held wholly responsible for the present messy situation . the administration should learn a lesson this time , albeit the hard way . mr president , ms wu 's motion is meant to reprove the government for the wrong move it has taken in dealing with the case at hand . i do not think ms wu is demanding that our system be changed from being executive - led to being legislative - led . i have clarified this point with ms wu . in the light of the foregoing , the liberal party and i support the motion . mr martin lee : mr president , the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 was at last passed after going through three readings in this council last week . mr lau chin - shek has also honoured his words by quitting the legislative council after the third reading of the bill . today , he is sitting at the public gallery listening to our debate . the government has been severely criticized by the public and the press since its withdrawal of the bill on 14 december last year . as the matter has come to an end , i think it is time for a review . even up to now , the governor , the chief secretary and the secretary for education and manpower still emphasize that the withdrawal of the bill is in compliance with the standing orders and that there is nothing wrong with it . it is undoubted that according to the standing orders , any person who proposes a bill has the right to withdraw the bill before the third reading no matter whether he is a government official or a member . yet , i hope the government will understand that being lawful does not necessarily mean that you are reasonable . the governor has the right to refuse to endorse any bills passed by the legislative council . but does it mean that such an act on the part of the governor is acceptable ? though we can see that remedial actions have been taken by the government since 14 december , the government still persistently claims that it has not done anything wrong . this is certainly not the attitude of any government official who has the courage to shoulder responsibility . now that mr lau chin - shek has resigned and the government 's reputation tarnished , how can we not draw lessons from this incident after paying such a heavy price ? we should look to the future and try to establish a proper relationship between the executive and the legislature . the resignation of mr lau chin - shek is not an isolated case . we should interpret this case by looking into the relationship between the executive and the legislature . it is in fact an interlude of the poor relationship between the executive and the legislature since 1991 . they are poorly co-ordinated and are often in conflicts . ever since the complete separation of the executive and the legislature by the governor , mr chris patten , communication between the two bodies has become more and more difficult . the government 's influence on the legislative council has diminished . i think after the legislative council election to be held later this year , the government will have to face even greater difficulty in the implementation of its policies since there will be no more appointed and ex officio members in this council . the biggest problem at the moment is that in the process of policy - making , representatives who stand for public opinion are excluded . just as what mr lau chin - shek has said , the core of the organizational system in hong kong is the governor in council and a handful of senior government officials . this centralization of power is fatally flawed in that the government will easily become deviated from the wishes of the people and make arbitrary decisions . if such is the case , the government will not be able to feel the pulse of the community and the legislative council . in the event that the decision of the governor in council is contrary to the wishes of the people , the administration will be criticized and opposed by the legislature . in order to maintain its dignity as an executive - led government , the administration will have to " take great pains to defend its resolution " and will finally resort to forcing the legislative council into submission arbitrarily . this is contrary to the democratic spirit of the system of representative government implemented in hong kong . while the community at large is heading for democracy , the government is going in an opposite direction , constantly exerting its power autocratically to suppress the representatives of the people . this is indeed a great irony upon the development of democracy in hong kong . in order to rationalize the relationship between the executive and the legislature , it is necessary to appoint legislators from different political parties to take up seats in the executive council - a request which i have repeatedly put forward for the government 's consideration . such an arrangement will enable the mainstream opinions of the legislative council to be reflected at the earliest possible time in the process of policy - making . the government has all along refused to open up the executive council on account of maintaining collective responsibility and the principle of confidentiality . in fact , a certain degree of collective responsibility and the principle of confidentiality can still be maintained even with the appointment of representatives from various parties into the executive council . for example , whenever a policy is supported by the executive council , party members who sit in the executive council will have to make an effort to persuade the fellow - members of their respective political parties to adopt a consistent stance in the legislative council . as for confidentiality , this principle exists in name only . as long as details of the executive council meetings , such as the names of those for or against a certain issue and the justification of their views are not disclosed , every member can express his standpoint though the media . in this connection , it is not convincing at all to refuse to open up the executive council on the basis of maintaining this principle . as the 1995 elections are drawing near , it is necessary for the government to announce in advance whether there are any new arrangements regarding the relationship between the executive and the legislature so as to let the candidates and the public know beforehand whether there are new ways to play the game after they are elected to sit in this council . i hope the government will realize that in order to solve the structural conflicts between the executive and the legislature , it should have the courage to make even greater changes , thereby setting a new standard for an open government and a democratic political framework in hong kong . otherwise , we will not be able to make any progress . we can only stay exactly as we are , waiting to see who will be the next to resign and the government to be criticized . mr president , with these remarks , the democratic party supports the motion . mr frederick fung : mr president , section 52 of the standing orders of the legislative council states that the member in charge of a bill may , at the beginning of the proceedings on a bill at a sitting , announce that he withdraws or postpones the bill . on 14 december last year , the secretary for education and manpower withdrew the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 . as far as the procedure was concerned , this act was not impeachable . however , it showed that the political wisdom of the government official concerned was indeed inadequate . he had always deemed the legislative council as the " yes men " of the executive authorities and was unable to realize that this amendment bill , in fact , did not command the support of the majority of members in this council . when the honourable lau chin - shek 's amendment to the bill was passed , the government official resorted to a shoddy political tactic by threatening to withdraw the bill . this had only further flared up the incident and unnecessarily intensified the confrontation between legislative councillors and government officials . in the aftermath of this stormy incident , the government explained that it still had to take into account the consensus of the labour advisory board ( lab ) , the implication being that mr lau chin - shek 's amendment had upset such a consensus . obviously , this explanation indicated that the government had either failed to realize or wilfully ignored that the legislative council was also a place for consultation of labour matters . the legislative council may have to respect and consider the consensus reached by the lab on the employment ( amendment ) bill , but it does not necessarily mean that the legislative council has to accept it as it is without making any amendment . now that some members had held a different view and proposed a different plan , further consultations among the representatives from the labour and employer sides present in this council as well as the government became all the more necessary for the lobbying involved during the process . this had to be done through the grounds and political techniques which they held and brought into full play in this council which was understood to be the ultimate place for such consultations . we should respect the outcome of the voting instead of forcing the members into submission by means of intimidation . the government appeared to be very decisive this time , but it only exposed the autocratic nature of a colonial government . this incident has made us realize that should the present framework of the executive authorities and the legislature be maintained , there is fear that the relationship between both parties will become more and more tense . the reason is that although the legislature has taken in the directly elected members who have a stronger base of popular support and can state their case to the government or even attempt to influence its policies , the power of check and balance of the legislature of hong kong is still very feeble . should this incident take place in a country with a sounder operation of the executive and legislation system , i believe that the government official or the ruling party responsible for making such a decision , under the continual criticism from members of the public , may have to step down or bear the political responsibility . however , in hong kong , a branch secretary is a civil servant . should branch secretaries make a wrong decision , some of them may be subject to internal sanction or may be transferred , but because the job is a life - long appointment , the official 's employment is still as secure as ever . moreover , there is no ruling party in hong kong . the officials who are in charge of making policies in the executive authorities do not have to go through any competitive institution but assume power for granted . even if they make mistakes , they do not have to bear the responsibility or face the risk of having to step down . in such a well - protected political greenhouse , the officials may not be able to adapt to the changes of the surrounding political environment or may not be sensitive enough to such changes . they still embrace the autocratic way of doing things in the past . having been repeatedly criticized by the members , the officials also harbour a certain resentment and regard us as only a group of politicans obsessed with making criticisms instead of constructive ideas , for the sole purpose of appealing to the voters . however , as long as the executive authorities continue to operate in the absence of any checks in the form of public opinion , and adopt an executive - led approach which is high - handed and autocratic , as long as civil servants still have to bear the unnecessary political responsibility , and as long as there is no early improvement to this system which is structurally defective , i believe this state of tension is bound to continue . to avoid the recurrence of this incident , the existing political structure has to be reformed to the very root . as a long - term solution , the governor or the chief executive might appoint non-civil servants who might have party applications to be branch secretaries , or even appoint these people to the executive council , which we may refer to as the cabinet , to take up the posts of director of different departments . they will then bear the political responsibility thus created . only with all the important executives of the executive and legislature authorities , including the chief executive , executive councillors , directors of various departments and legislative councillors , subject to the effective checks and balances of public opinion , can the present strained relationship resulting from the government officials ' hostility towards the legislative councillors be effectively eliminated . in countries which have developed a sounder relationship between the executive and legislative authorities , although the relationship between the two is antagonistic , there is also a sense of competition at the same time . the kind of antagonism found in the separation of powers , such as in the parliamentary system at westminster , reveals to us a loyal opposition party exerting regulatory checks and balances on the ruling party . comparing with the united kingdom , the united states has an even more distinct separation of the three powers in its constitutional system . the opposition between the executive and the legislative branches has the voters acting as the final arbitrators to decide on the incumbents for the executive authorities and the legislature , under the checks and balances of public opinion , when both sides are faced with a certain constraint , they must bear the responsibility for their own acts and let the voters make the final decision as to who and which political party are to be trusted . finally , i would like to express some of my feelings about the disputes within the labour sector caused by this incident . after the lau chin - shek incident , i feel that the government alone is to blame . however , the labour sector has shown us that they have disputes among themselves . their finger - pointing at one another can easily help the government to get off lightly in this incident . this was originally a matter about the fight for the rights and benefits of the workers . but the difference in strategies has led to a certain life - and - death struggle within the sector and evolved into some political feud . in the end , those who reap the benefit are the government and the employers . i hope that the labour sector can see clearly that the very aim of the labour movement is to fight for the rights and benefits of the workers . if they continue attacking one another , they will just let the chance to win rights and benefits from the government and the employers slip away . i hope that when this incident is over , the labour sector can learn from their experience , unite together and treat the rights and benefits of the workers as their first priority . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr martin barrow : mr president , i rise to express my disappointment that the honourable anna wu has felt it necessary and appropriate to put forward this motion , which i do not regard as being constructive to the overall relationship between the administration and this council . far too much emotional discussion was swirling around this council and the community generally in december when the government , quite rightly in my view , withdrew the bill . it is ludicrous to suggest , as some have , that the government considers the legislative council as a rubber stamp , that it has " no regards for workers " or does not care about the legislative council . look at the enormous time and trouble that civil servants take with legislative council members ; some spend almost half their time developing good working relations with this council and responding to members ' queries . look at the dozens of civil servants who come to this building everyday to brief members or to appear before various panels . i am already concerned that civil servants spend too much time reporting on their work rather than actually getting on with the job . major culture changes have been going on , with an impressive drive towards ensuring an effective , efficient and responsive civil service . i applaud both the work of the efficiency unit in spearheading the reforms , and the adaptability of the civil service to these changes . i particularly admire the sense of accountability to the community and the spirit of service which the civil servants so openly display - regarding , as they do , the people of hong kong as customers . this is a time when this council should be giving maximum support to the administration , rather than " reproving " or criticizing it on one issue after another . this is why i object to the motion 's use of the word " reprove " - strong language in my view and not appropriate for use in the debating process . i object to the suggestion that the government has no " regards for workers " . if this council was to poll the business community , it would find many speaking out with just the opposite viewpoint , giving examples of the raft of new pro-labour legislation which has been put through in recent years . this council would also find many believing that the government was tilting away from positive non-interventionism towards an over - regulated society which will stifle the very enterprise that has created hong kong . mr president , this council is no rubber stamp . ms anna wu tells us that these are just " fine words " but i would say the same about her motion . as i have demonstrated above , our civil servants fully recognize the role of this council : our examination and approval of government finances , the very detailed work on legislation and the questioning of the government on a whole range of policy issues . surely we should remember that the government reaches compromise after compromise with us on a whole range - indeed an ever - widening range - of issues . i do not accept for one moment that the government 's legitimate use of its power to withdraw the bill undermines the effectiveness of the legislative council . i would argue instead that the proposed amendments undermined the effectiveness of , and indeed would demolish , the well - tried and tested consultation process which has served hong kong so well . the very fact that the government went back to the labour advisory board to relook at the issue illustrates both that the system works and that the government listens to the view of the legislative council . the labour advisory board made a tremendous effort to reach a consensus on a way forward - for example , working on christmas eve and new year 's eve to attain an acceptable solution . the improved package , in the form of the employment ( amendment ) bill , was comprehensive with progressive improvements over a specified period of time . it was more far - reaching than the recommendations reported to be proposed in the private member 's bill and was , of course , approved without opposition . in conclusion , mr president , the administration recognizes the rights of members to move amendments to a bill , and likewise , we should respect the administration 's right to withdraw a bill from time to time , when it feels that such action is necessary . recognition of the reality of an executive - led government does not mean an erosion of the legislative council 's power , nor is circumscribing the constitutional role of this legislature which cannot in any way be regarded as a rubber stamp . with these words , i oppose the motion . mr simon ip : mr president , in addressing this council in 1991 , sir david ford assessed the position of the administration in the changing political environment leading up to 1997 . he warned that : " we must be careful ..... not to drift into a series of situations in which the government is isolated because it has no built - in support . there is a real danger of this because there is a perception in hong kong that , to be popular , a politician must sometimes be seen to be openly critical of the administration . " our political system is a strange hybrid in which there exists a permanent ruling administration and a permanent opposition , which never swap roles as they do in westminster or washington . the opposition has found its raison d ' etre in criticism of the government , challenging the heretofore unchallengeable policies of the bureaucracy . this new resistance has forced the executive to become more political than it would otherwise opt to be because it now has to convince the opposition , rather than simply railroad it . at times during the consideration of the employment ( amendment ) bill , it did seem that the government was railroading the legislature , and i would sympathize with those who wish to reprove it for doing so . the resignation of our esteemed colleague , the honourable lau chin - shek , forces us , however , to examine this matter carefully . with the civil service and its various advisory bodies behind it , the government always has a certain degree of built - in support . so when it comes to the legislative council , it should not and , i believe , does not come looking for automatic approval of its policies . because of the adversarial nature of this council after democratic reforms , the executive , while it may seek consensus , comes to the legislative council ready to do battle . a more adversarial legislature means a more politicized legislative - executive relationship . the result is a higher degree of strategy , negotiation and occasional chicanery . sir david ford thought the civil service should remain apolitical . i do not see how it can . the politicization of the legislative process means that the politicians and the civil service are increasingly playing by the same rules and still getting the job done . although the progress on the employment ( amendment ) bill seemed to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the system , the final result was acceptable to all , the exception of course being the unfortunate resignation of mr lau chin - shek . but the fact that the conflict was resolved is proof that the system can indeed work . members should not be surprised that the government does resort to constitutional or political resources it has at its disposal to prevail in legislation . i cannot think of a single effective government anywhere in the world where the executive does not have some check over the power of the legislature . the whims of the majority in the legislature cannot go unchecked by an executive branch , seasoned in the administration of policies and legislative implementation . in every established constitutional democracy , the executive has the right of veto or some procedure for resolution of conflict between the executive and the legislature . i see no compelling reason why this tried and tested formula should be abandoned here in hong kong . nor do i think it accurate to describe as " undemocratic " systems that prescribe for the power of veto , or of the dissolution of the legislature , should the ruling party lose the upperhand . but then some may counter my argument by stressing that the government has no ruling majority , nor any direct mandate from the people of hong kong . those who advance this argument hold further that the lack of a popular mandate means that the government should listen to those other political figures and institutions that do have such a mandate . this council is perceived to be such a body , or the nearest thing that hong kong has to such a body . and i would agree . but those who are of such an opinion take it too far if they suggest that the executive must adopt a slavish adherence to the decisions of this council . nor is it clear that when the government openly disagrees with this council that it shows disrespect for the legislative council 's decision - making authority on legislative matters . is this to say that politics should avoid all conflict , all negotiation , all differences of opinion and become a game of mutual affirmation , where legislators ' views are acceded to by a submissive executive branch ? my answer is no . the executive should , and must , remain strong and have a view of its own , independent of the legislature . it should be able to act on its views , sometimes in conflict with the legislature to which it is accountable but not subservient . to suggest otherwise would in my view blur the time - honoured principle of separation of powers . under the letters patent and standing orders , the deck may well be stacked in favour of the administration , but the rules are clear . they allow unpopular decisions to prevail from time to time , but this is true of all systems everywhere . as i see it , a vibrant constitutional tradition is beginning to develop , where the power of the legislature will come into its own , even if it does not always prevail . this is evident from the daily work of bills committees and the passage of bills through this council . most bills are amended , some very substantially , in committee stage with or without the administration 's approval . the employment ( amendment ) bill was the only occasion during my term as a legislative councillor when a bill had been withdrawn after an amendment was carried without the administration 's approval . mr president , i cannot detect any bad faith on the part of the government on the occasion when it withdrew the bill and i can see no room for reproval . i therefore do not support the motion . mrs elsie tu : mr president , i agree that the matter of the withdrawal of the employment ( amendment ) bill was dealt with in a clumsy manner . the fact that it was later amended and finally passed almost unanimously last week indicates that the government had not done its homework thoroughly in the first place , to make sure that all views had been heard , and that an acceptable decision had been reached before putting it before the council . however , maybe we can accept some portion of the blame ourselves that none of us suggested setting up a bills committee to discuss the government 's new proposals during the period between the first and second withdrawal of the bill . the most regrettable part of all is that we lost a hardworking member . i feel that he might not have resigned if we had all been fully briefed both by the government and by the member himself on the consequences of a second withdrawal of the bill . that regrettable result has raised emotions and anger , as well as queries on whether or not it was necessary to resign before the government had made its intentions clear on the way ahead after the withdrawal . perhaps all of us , both the government and ourselves , can learn a lesson in liaison and compromise to make sure that a bill is acceptable to the majority of members before it is put to the vote . minority objections can then be voiced during the debate . but surely confrontation should not be the sole means of gaining popularity and winning votes . in our present economic and political see - saw situation , we need to keep cool heads . the latter part of ms wu 's motion calls upon the government to maintain the public 's confidence in the legislative council and the democratic system . i am not aware that the hong kong system is or ever has been a democratic one . this government , like it or not ( and i have made clear throughout my life that i do not like colonial systems ) , is still colonial , with only three members of the ruling party on this legislature . it claims to be , and is , executive - led . there is no party in power to form its cabinet , except the colonial party . as long as the government remains colonial , with no elected party in power to form a cabinet , it will have to remain executive - led . and as long as the government remains executive - led , the legislative council has no choice but to seek amendments to bills and policies by compromise between ourselves and the administration . separated from the executive council as we are , the legislative council can only act in opposition . if that happens , and we act in opposition frequently , the council will become like a game of football in which there are several different teams all playing the same game on the same field and each trying to get the ball ( that is , the bill ) into its own political goal . given this situation , mr president , i am not clear what is meant by " the democratic system " in the motion before us . perhaps ms wu can clarify this point in her reply . ms emily lau : i rise to support the honourable ms anna wu 's motion . that particular act of the government last year is most regrettable . as a result of it , this council lost its member , the honourable mr lau chin - shek , who is widely supported by both his colleagues and members of the public . i agree to most of what ms anna wu has said , and i do not want to repeat here . i think that the government made a series of mistakes in that particular incident . the first mistake : i am convinced that on that day , the government did not try to carry out any vote counting beforehand . maybe , the government was so confident of rallying enough support that it decided vote counting was not necessary . then , in a fit of fury induced by loss of face , it hastened to withdraw the bill on realizing that it did not have enough votes . the move roused the outcry of members of this council and infuriated all in hong kong . in this context , we can certainly understand why mr lau chin - shek announced his decision to resign . we also feel sorry about his resignation . however , we feel even more sorry about the government 's action to challenge the authority of this council . just now , the honourable mr simon ip made a very good point that various systems of checks and balances are found in other countries to regulate the relationship between the executive and the legislature . as clearly pointed out by ms anna wu , the government of hong kong is not a product of democratic elections . the government must bear this point in mind . it is only after surmounting numerous obstacles that we have managed to have a small number of elected seats in this council , which is why we very much hope that the legislative council can establish itself as a legislative authority among members of the public . but , after this incident , all our efforts over the years have been ruined overnight . to be frank , if members want to wrestle with the government , they are not entirely without means . the government comes to the finance committee every week to ask for appropriations , and many bills also need our consent for them to be carried . does the government want members of this council to behave like their counterparts in the american congress , dragging in all issues as a means of bargaining ? does the government want to create a situation under which we will simply reject a particular appropriation request if a certain bill is not passed ? i do not believe that the government wants this to happen . the government should know only too well that in this disgraceful incident , many pro-government members turned their backs on the government and voted in support of the amendments moved by mr lau chin - shek . is this not sufficient proof that the amendments moved by mr lau chin - shek did have substantial support in this council ? has such an idea ever occurred to the government ? why has the government behaved like this ? mr president , i agree with some members that this incident has highlighted what the relationship between the executive and the legislature is really like . i hope that the government can give an overhaul to this relationship as soon as possible . relying solely on vote counting and canvassing by directorate officials is not enough . we need to have an executive council with legislative councillors sitting on it so that they can assist in the formulation of policies and later promote them in the legislative council . such a fusion of powers is desirable because it can help promote government policies both in this council and in the community at large . and , what is most important is the legislative council 's support that comes with it . after this disgraceful incident , i talked to a number of high - ranking government officials , and even some executive councillors . none of them supported the government , nor could they see why the government had taken such a course of action . even if adjournment was not sought , the government could always , as soon as it chose to , put forward yet another bill to seek further amendments . the point is that by agreeing to proceed to voting that day , the government should know that it had agreed to abide by the outcome . however , what happened at the end was that when the outcome did not please it , the government simply took the ball away like a spoiled child who had lost this temper , saying that he was no longer interested in the game . this kind of behaviour is not in line with the image we have had of the government over the years . i do not know what went wrong with the government 's thinking that day . just now , some members criticized us for showing no respect for the labour advisory board ( lab ) . respect there should be for the lab , but i must make it clear that the legislative power resides ultimately in the legislative council . this is the case now and will be the case in the future . for that reason , the legislative council deserves more respect than anybody else . i hope the government will think it all over again and avoid any such behaviour in the future . having said all this , i want to express my disapproval of a point raised by ms anna wu just now . she said that in case of similar incidents in the future , a private member 's bill should be put forward right away . i cannot quite catch what she really means . however , since every bill should be carefully handled and considered by members of this council , i think that a member simply should not spring to his feet during a legislative council sitting , put forward a private member 's bill and expect it to be carried instantaneously . mr president , i hope the government can learn a lesson from this incident and refrain from similar behaviour in the future . i admit that the executive should have its own powers , but it is just as important to recognize that the ultimate legislative power resides in the legislative council . how can this conflict be resolved ? i believe that the relationship between the executive and the legislature must be overhauled so that some legislative councillors can sit on the executive council to participate in the formulation of government policies . it is only in this way that greater acceptance can be ensured when government policies are considered by this council . finally , i agree with ms anna wu that the resources available to the legislative council are insufficient . other things aside , mr president , you should know only very well that , our library , or archives room , manned only by a few staff members , is just a room of empty bookshelves . this has been the case for more than a year already . if the government really wants to assist the work of the legislative council , why has it failed to equip us with the most basic necessities . we all know that access to information implies power . the government does not want members to have greater access to information , as such an access would enable us to monitor the work of the government more effectively . however , we will certainly continue our efforts in securing these things . with these remarks , i support the motion . dr yeung sum : mr president , it is regrettable that mr michael leung , secretary for education and manpower , withdrew the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 after its second reading . the government has emphasized time and again that the withdrawal conforms with standing orders and is therefore legal . furthermore , it has argued that , as an executive - led administration , it certainly has the power to withdraw the bills proposed by it at any time it deems fit during the legislative process . i think these two points are open to question . first of all , let me make it clear that the hong kong government , as an executive - led administration , can of course propose bills and recommend policies and budgets to this council . however , the word " executive - led " does not mean dictatorship of the executive , under which the secretaries are free to do whatever they want , in total disregard for the operation principles of this council . the government has all along stressed that it holds itself accountable to the legislature , which in turn acts as its monitor . under this principle , members of course have the power to amend the bills put forward by the government . but to our surprise , mr michael leung , secretary for education and manpower , withdrew the employment ( amendment ) bill after amendments to the bill moved by the honourable lau chin - shek was carried in the second reading , dealing an abrupt blow to the operation of this council . mr president , given the principles of representative democracy , there is no guarantee that all the bills proposed by the government can be passed , unless government members are in the majority in this council , or all legislative councillors are appointed , as was the case in the past . however , since the introduction of some directly elected seats in 1991 , the government has had only three votes in this council . this situation , coupled with the fact that all directly elected members have to be accountable to the public , has exerted pressure on the government to a certain extent . in the past , the government often managed to obtain enough backing both in this council and the finance committee largely because the government officials concerned had conducted adequate lobbying beforehand . but this time , before the debate on the employment ( amendment ) bill , the officials concerned simply did not conduct any lobbying . then , when it realized that things were going against it , the government hastened to withdraw the bill for lack of a better alternative in order to uphold its authoritative image . unfortunately , however , the withdrawal of the bill has achieved the opposite result of impairing the government 's authoritative image , in addition to violating the principle of accountability . mr president , i am of the opinion that once it has proposed a bill , the government should abide by the rules of representative democracy and the decisions so reached , in much the same way as legislative councillors do , unless amendments moved by members would seriously affect the administrative operation of the government . mr president , the amendment moved by the honourable lau chin - shek differed slightly from the official amendment . i just wonder if the administrative operation of the government would really be seriously affected by increasing the combined amount of long service payment and severance pay from $180,000 to $230,000 ? i tend to feel that instead of adopting a pragmatic approach , the government was just trying desperately to defend its authoritative image . mr president , the government 's withdrawal of the bill is at best legal under standing orders , but certainly not sensible and reasonable . in my opinion , the principle of open government can be realized only when the administration 's acts of governance are in line , not only with legality , but also with good sense and reason . the government officials ' mechanical application of standing orders in disregard for good sense and reasons will only lead to tension between the executive and the legislature . we can still recall how the government tried to rationalize its decision to withdraw the bill by quoting the consensus of the labour advisory board ( lab ) as an excuse . has the government really given full respect to the opinions of all advisory committees , including those of the lab ? furthermore , a lab member has pointed out that the lab had hardly been given any chance to deliberate on the $180,000 - ceiling again . this shows that the so - called consensus of the lab is merely an excuse used by the government so that it could back down without losing face . mr president , i hope that the withdrawal of bills by the government will not become a regular practice in future . mr patten , the governor , has pointed out that in the representative assemblies of some foreign countries , the ruling parties may also withdraw bills that they have proposd , when warranted by circumstances . mr president , the example cited by the governor tells only part of the story because members of representative assemblies in other countries and the ruling parties are returned by popular elections , and , thus , to a certain extent , they have the people 's mandate . since they are returned by popular elections , the ruling parties have to be accountable to the voters . but what we have in hong kong is still a colonial system , which has remained undemocratic so far . although some of the seats in this council are directly elected , ours is still not a democratic system . given this , swift reforms to this council 's operation are certainly required . we are of the opinion that since neither the governor nor his secretaries are returned by popular elections and thus they do not have the people 's mandate , it is inappropriate for them to rationalize the withdrawal of the bill by citing the parliamentary practice of other countries . mr president , for the good operation of this council in future , i would like to suggest that the government should respect the relationship between the executive and the legislature , which means that it must pay due regard to the operation of this council . once a bill is introduced , the government should abide by this council 's decision and should not withdraw the bill rashly unless the decision would seriously affect the operation of the government . if we are to establish a reasonable system of parliamentary democracy , both the executive and the legislature have their own part to play . finally , i would like to point out that the unanimous support in this council for our decision this time can aptly illustrate the success of the last - ditch efforts made by the lab , the government and legislative councillors . this lesson is one that the government must learn . as a conclusion , the colonial style of government and the related mentality should be completely abandoned . nostalgia for the style of governance in the past is no longer in keeping with the times . miss christine loh : mr president , what have we really learnt from the employment ( amendment ) bill affair ? the message from the administration seems to be : amend at your peril . the honourable anna wu describes it as a hostage - taking strategy , and i am afraid i tend to agree with her . the strategy abandons dialogue and compromise and transforms the legislative process into a zero - sum game : either pass the legislation in the form the administration can accept or run the risk of having no legislation at all . this council deals with matters of great importance to the people of hong kong . the administration cannot treat the legislative process as a game in which everyone has to use the same ball which they provide . we do not accept the administration 's notion of accountability : where it explains its policy to this council , it listens to our suggestions and our criticisms and then it can proceed to ignore them . and if we persist , then the administration has shown itself to be quite capable of bullying us . i worry that we are seeing the same strategy in action in the way that the administration is dealing with the equal opportunities bill . suggestions that the administration 's own sex discrimination bill is deeply flawed are consistently met by assertions that modifications might delay the passage of the bill . surely that sort of argument is purely technical , not a matter of substance . many members would like the administration to address all areas of discrimination and to abolish the small house policy . but what sort of response are we getting ? knowing its positions to be weak , the administration now says that it is ready to consider consulting the public on age , sexuality , marital status and maybe even union membership . but let us not mistake that vague promise to consult the public as a commitment to legislate for those important areas . it is plain that the administration is only trying to delay the equal opportunities bill . as for political and racial discrimination , oh , no ! they are too difficult - too difficult for the administration to try and tackle right now . as its arguments fail to persuade us , i fear that the administration might use the equal opportunities commission to hold us hostage . why do i say this ? firstly , the administration knows that we want the equal opportunities commission . secondly , the legislative provision to establish the commission is controlled by the administration since a private member 's bill cannot be used to set it up without the administration 's approval . therefore , from the way the administration has dealt with the employment ( amendment ) bill , i fear that it could use the commission to make sure that we do not stray too far from the administration 's own sex discrimination bill . otherwise , the administration could threaten to withdraw the entire bill . sorry , friends , no commission . the administration also tries to paint our complaints in these areas as unreasonable . it argues that the legislative and financial priorities are carefully formulated by the executive , or even by an advisory body , like the labour advisory board , and so should not be altered by legislators . the administration likes to point to practices elsewhere to buttress its argument to limit legislators ' powers to amend government bills , or , god forbid , move entire private member 's bills . but such comparison , as dr the honourable yeung sum has explained , is wholly inappropriate and misleading in the case of hong kong . mr president , i regret to say that hong kong is not yet a democracy . in a democracy , of course , a government 's decision to block consideration of important matters of public interest can ultimately be overcome by a vote to remove the government from power . unfortunately we do not have the privilege to do so . in hong kong , the administration , which is the government 's party , is wholly unelected . policy is made by a handful of civil servants along with a small coterie of unelected , unaccountable , part - time advisers to the governor . is this the kind of executive - led government which is good for hong kong ? i doubt it very much . mr president , we need to urgently re-define what is meant by an executive - led government . the honourable miss emily lau has already spoken about the need to have legislators in the executive council . both miss lau and ms wu have called for more resources to the legislature to give it the efficiency and professionalism to play its role as a legislature worthy of the people of hong kong . i agree with them both wholeheartedly on these two points . the administration should not be allowed to keep this council under - funded , to keep us weak and ineffective . the administration should not be allowed to do it because it is wrong and that it is bad for hong kong . mr president , i support the motion . mr james tien : mr president , the crux of the motion debate today is not about the employment ( amendment ) bill or the resignation of mr lau chin - shek from the legislative council but about whether the government should be executive - led . the business sector has always viewed hong kong 's economic success as a direct result of a government which makes policy decisions through consultation with relevant boards and committees . the legislative council 's role is to monitor , advise and amend proposals which the administration can accept . there is no question of the legislative council being a rubber stamp for the government whose bills it scrutinizes , expenditure it vets , performance it grades and mistakes it cites . we are bound by oath to do all these things . however , we are not out to stifle the administration or be a council vested with executive powers . the business community had impressed on both china and britain to keep such an executive - led government . the principle is now enshrined in the joint declaration and reaffirmed in articles 59 and 62 of the basic law . i believe deeply in the work and responsibilities of the legislative council , for i am one of the few whose family members have had the honour of serving the council for two generations . i would be the last to want to devalue the legislature . nevertheless , we legislators have to understand our constitutional position in hong kong where there are checks and balances . the pillars of such a system are the executive administration which includes the governor , the executive council and advisory committees , the legislative council and an independent judiciary . more than ever , such checks and balances must be preserved . at present , this council has three government officials out of 60 legislators . by september there will be none . how then can the executive function when this council may amend any government proposal to such a drastic point where a bill 's initial intention is negated ? the only alternative is for the government to withdraw the bill for another reading as a last resort - i do emphasize " last resort " . standing order 52 of the legislative council grants the government such a power . this power may prompt more councillors to co-operate with the administration for a consensus . the outcome of this should be one with councillors listening to the government 's opinions and they to ours . the government rarely takes back proposals . why ? because any time the government withdraws a bill after finding the legislative council amendments unacceptable , it goes out on a limb . a legislator should have the same right so that anyone who puts up a bill may recall it if it is amended to beyond recognition . the honourable anna wu , for one , should have the option of withdrawing her private member 's bill on equal opportunities if , for argument 's sake , it is not only voted down but turned upside down . the employment ( amendment ) bill which sparked this row was not just a government proposal . the labour advisory board ( lab ) stood behind the agreement on severance and long service payment compensations after several long reviews . the lab is more representative of employer - employee relations than the legislators behind the motion debate today . half of lab 's members are elected from the labour union sector and the other half from the employers ' ranks such as the federation of hong kong industries and the hong kong general chamber of commerce . the lab 's employer representatives have made a series of three concessions - in july and december 1994 and recently - to reach an agreement that satisfies the democratic camp in this council . but there has to be a limit to what the employers can afford . coupled with more labour benefits , we have continuing high inflation , high annual salary increases , rising interest cost , shrinking export market , and recently a sharp fall in property prices and the stock market . it is not easy to survive in business . i dread the day when more small employers decide it is not worth the effort to be in business and wind up for good . after all , the foundation of hong kong 's economic success rests with small entrepreneurs whose fighting spirit is admired around the world . the lab mandate is to strike a balance between the two sides and it has done well . by fostering cordial labour - management ties , it has a direct impact on hong kong 's success . a similar balance in the council is likely to be tipped in this coming september when there will be nine new functional constituencies which are direct election seats in disguise . by then , the government must be able to stand up for the overall interest of hong kong rather than cave in to unreasonable demands of those who always claim to act in the name of one - person - one - vote populism . i resist the downgrading of the lab whose importance should increase , not decrease on employer - employee matters . the legislative council can do much but it cannot displace the advisory committees which pool together public opinion and private sector expertise this assembly sometimes lacks . i object to councillors discrediting institutions whose powers and influence they want to take over . the legislative council and the advisory committees have co-existed for a long time . they complement each other . they are not mutually exclusive . investors still rate hong kong as the best place to do business . they would not be so enthusiastic about the territory if it is racked with labour - management tensions and if its government becomes ineffective . mr president , the views i have expressed today also reflect overwhelmingly those of the general committees of the federation of hong kong industries , of which i am its legislative council representative , and the hong kong general chamber of commerce , of which i am its vice chairman . the liberal party took the matter into consideration and will vote for the motion as expressed by the honourable allen lee . i have sought exemption from the liberal party stance under its article of association 8.6.3 and i will vote differently . mr president , with these remarks , i oppose the motion . mr roger luk : mr president , the three winners of the nobel prizes in economics this year are scholars engaged in research on the game theory . in short , the game theory is an analysis of a zero - sum game in which a player either wins or loses . it is an analysis of the behavioural pattern of each player in his attempt to defeat his opponent . if a player wants to gain the upper hand in a game , besides seeking for his own advantages , he also has to estimate his opponent 's strength and chance of winning . couple with the fact that the response of the opponent is always an unknown factor , the player has to encounter always changing developing circumstances and " one wrong move would jeopardize the whole game " . the game theory is a profound subject , incomprehensible to the economist and totally mystifying to the layman . however , the game theory has now been extensively applied in studies in real life behaviours , such as the determination of prices , voting inclinations , military strategies and so on . when this council met on 14 december last year , the whole process of debating and voting on the amendments to the ceiling of long service payment and severance payment moved by mr lau chin - shek during the debate on the second reading of the employment ( amendment ) bill is a practical example of an ingenious application of the game theory . i remember that on 6 july last year , although mr lau chin - shek had surprisingly succeeded in amending the bill during its second reading , the bill was rejected during the third reading . after this incident , when the bill was introduced in this council again , the government and mr lau had already thought of the possible moves by the other party and had worked out the " best strategy " . hence , both parties insisted on what they believed to be the best and would not change their stance in the middle of the process , and yet both parties did not know what cards their opponent was actually holding ; so when one side threatened to withdraw the bill , the other side threatened to resign in gratitude for the public 's support . both parties refused to give ground and this resulted in a deadlock . however , whoever ties the bell is in the best position to untie it . after consultation with the labour advisory board ( lab ) , the government introduced a new bill which provided a solution to the issues this council was concerned with , namely , the ceilings of the reckonable years of service and the total payments . last week , this council finally passed a bill that was welcomed by all . after all these rows over the years , the reforms on the long service payment and severance payment were settled before the chinese new year . the welfare of employees is actually linked with the people 's livelihood . it was totally unexpected that it should become a political issue . on that day , both parties refused to give ground , swords were drawn , bows were bent , and the atmosphere was even more disturbing . parliamentary politics is an art of compromise and balance . if everyone insists on his own views , refuses to give ground and is easily swayed by personal feelings , it would not do anything good . another party involved in this incident was the lab . mr james tien has just expounded the role played by the lab in this incident . the prosperity of hong kong owes much to the mutually forbearing attitude of the employers over the years . the achievements of the lab as a statutory advisory body are also obvious to all . therefore , the consensus reached by the lab should be respected . however , any consensus reached by the lab can only be put into effect through legislation and public opinion has to be taken into account . take the present amendments to the long service payment and severance payment as an example , most members of this council had reservations in respect of the existing methods of calculation of the reckonable years of service and the ceiling of total payment . this showed that the consensus reached by the lab was still not satisfactory enough , otherwise , mr lau chin - shek 's amendments would not have gained the support of the majority . mr lau chin - shek 's uncompromising attitude which could lead to destruction of good and bad alike is not commendable either . although the lab has at last come up with a better package , it is politically unwise to take such a risky step of either success or death . mr president , the 14 december incident is a blemish in the history of the development of parliamentary politics in hong kong . withdrawal of a bill or threatening to resign as an effort to persuade to the last should never happen again . i hope that such incidents would not happen in the future , in particular , after september this year , as the government will have a fully elected legislative council . based on these remarks , i shall cast an abstention vote . mr ngai shiu - kit : mr president , during the late transitional period , not only the government should take up the responsibility to maintain social stability and reduce internal conflicts , we as members of the council should also dedicate ourselves to performing our duty and try our best to maintain the existing system which has been proved to be effective so that the public will continue to have confidence in our constitutional structure . neither the government nor members should try to stir things up and cause unnecessary disputes , thereby jeopardizing social stability and unity . mr president , every kind of game has its own set of rules and the participants should respect the rules , otherwise the game would be reduced to a farce . this is why the various parties concerned have agreed that the labour advisory board ( lab ) should discuss the issue of amending the employment ordinance . the lab is composed of representatives recognized by both the employees and the employers . moreover , the decision of the lab is arrived at after repeated discussions and careful deliberations . conclusion is made only after taking into full consideration the interests of all parties involved . if we override such a conclusion and strike a blow at the normal operation of this consultative mechanism just because the conclusion departs from the subjective expectations of certain people , such an action will only reveal the hypocrisy of the perpetrators who would " hold cards just to their advantages " . as regards the government , it has mishandled the issue of the employment ( amendment ) bill . it just withdrew the bill without making any efforts to secure support beforehand or arguing strongly on its grounds afterwards . judging from what it has done , it seems that the government also pays no respect to the agreement reached by the lab . it challenges the effective mechanism established by itself . why did the government try to dismantle the mechanism which has been running effectively over the years ? what is its objective ? the government owes to the public an explanation . mr president , the executive branch has always been the final decision - maker in respect of policies of our society , whether big or small . it is an irrefutable political fact and this system has proved to be effective . under the basic principle of being executive - led , the legislative council is of course vested with the power to move amendments to bills drafted by the executive branch ; this does not mean that the legislative council can take the place of government departments and manipulate the policies of the whole territory , nor does it mean that all decisions made by the legislative council are sacrosanct while the drafted bills presented by the executive branch can be completely ignored . every member who is familiar with the operation of our political system and is determined to maintain social stability will agree that the overriding principle of being executive - led should not and must not be impaired . mr president , some people may think that opposing ms anna wu 's motion means supporting the government 's practice , while favouring ms wu 's motion means disagreeing with the government 's practice . however , i must point out that it is not necessary to put an equal sign between the two because they are not necessarily related logically . i do not agree to the way in which the government has handled the case and , indeed , i was quite disappointed . yet , this does not mean that i support ms anna wu 's motion . it is because i believe that the maintainence of the public 's confidence in the legislative council and the democratic system rely very much on upholding the principle of being executive - led . only an executive - led government can promise smooth operation of the political system of hong kong , maintain social stability and sustain prosperous development of the economy professionals from the industrial and commercial fields attribute the success of hong kong to this very factor . mr president , the democratic system which we have adopted in should be able to accommodate the interests of society as a whole , implementing policies in accordance with established mechanisms . the opinions of the minority should of course be taken into account but the agreement reached by the lab , which comprises representatives of both the employers and the employees , should also be respected and put into practice . this is the spirit of democracy . however , some opportunists have tried to distort this belief , attempting to gain popularity through sensational appeals and to win over political support under the disguise of upholding democracy . in view of this , how can the people of hong kong not lose confidence in the legislative council and the democratic system ? mr president , we need council members who are pragmatic , fair and just to strive to safeguard the stability and prosperity of hong kong both at present and in future . to understand a person , one should look at his performance . i believe that every citizen " who has a clear head " will be able to differentiate those who really want to serve our society and work for the betterment of hong kong from those politicians who only know how to stage political shows and shout empty slogans . mr president , these are my remarks . because of the principles i has stated in the foregoing , the constituency to which i belong and i oppose the motion . mr james to : mr president , my speech will be very short as i just wish to discuss one issue today . the government has not answered but i believe its answer will not be much different from the argument it put forward on 14 december last year . why did the government withdraw the bill ? the answer is as follows : it is because the government is executive - led , the views of the labour advisory board ( lab ) have to be respected , no amendment should be put forward without prior discussion with the lab , and the lab being a time - honoured mechanism , its decision should not be disregarded , or else the consensus mechanism established for decades between the employers and employees will be damaged . i wish to unmask the hypocracy of the government in putting forth such an argument . the repeated claims made by the government that it respected the lab were in fact false . the main reason is that the government would " lose - hit , win - take " . why do i say that ? it is because when mr lau chin - shek moved the amendment to the employment ordinance for the first time in the last council session , the government did not propose to withdraw the bill at the third reading . why did it not withdraw the bill at that time ? the reason was simple . it was because the government , having counted the votes , knew from the number of members present and that of those who could be summoned back that the liberal party could summon sufficient number of members to vote so that the amendment would definitely be voted down . therefore , mr lau chin - shek was allowed to be responsible for moving the third reading and the government just did nothing . neither did it move the third reading nor propose to withdraw the bill . according to the government 's current logic , it should have withdrawn the bill at that time because so long as the bill had the chance of being carried at the legislative council , it would have already contravened the government 's logic . nevertheless , the government did not withdraw the bill last time . this time , after counting the votes , the government found that there would not be enough votes to negate the third reading . as a result , it immediately withdrew the bill . what the government has done is actually self-contradictory . as the honourable ngai shiu - kit just said , the government has never respected the lab . it was only when there were enough votes that the government would allow this council to vote down the motion at the third reading and then go back to the negotiation table again . it is the government itself that has put on a hypocritical appearance . secondly , i would like members to know that the government did threaten this council before . many people might not know about this and i wish to put it on record . during the deliberation of the landlord and tenant ( amendment ) bill , two issues were being discussed . the first issue concerned with the gradual relaxation of rental control while the second concerned with raising compensation to tenants of demolished buildings . officials of the home affairs branch told this council at that time that if members voted down the provision concerning the relaxation of rental control and only supported an increase in compensation to the owners in the bills committee , the government might withdraw the whole bill as the bill was a unified package . they also warned that if this really happened , many tenants of demolished buildings might suffer losses and members had to bear the liability . we can see that a precedent had already been set at that time . nevertheless , after counting the votes , the government eventually managed to find enough members to vote for the whole bill . but i wish to bring this up just to let everyone know that the government did use this to threaten us before . thirdly , the government has mentioned something about the rules of the game . a number of members have also touched on this point . our rationale is that legality does not equate with reasonableness . if the government says it can withdraw any bill at any time , i cannot but ask the government to inform us that besides the lab ' consensus , what other committees ' consensus would be taken as an infallible law that no amendment can be made at all . i wish that the government can give us a reply . in a law - governed society , if the government considers such committees are superior to the legislative council , should it propose a bill providing that the legislative power of the legislative council is subject to limitation and resolutions made by certain committees are beyond amendment ? if these can be clearly specified , it will be in better conformity with the practice of a law - governed society . with these remarks , i support the motion . dr tang siu - tong : mr president , last year , despite strong opposition from this council and members of the public , the government drastically increased the rates beyond reasonable limits irrespective of our enormous surplus . using the letters patent as a defence , the government even rejected the proposal of this council to amend th rating ( amendment ) bill , thus leading this council to move an unprecedented motion to reprove the government some seven months ago . after the rating incident , rather than learning from its errors , the government slipped back into its old ways in handling the employment ( amendment ) bill and once again withdrew an amended bill passed by this council . while the government have enough legal backing for what it did , its bureaucratic mentality that " official authority should permit no challenge " has been entirely revealed . this type of bureaucratic mentality , marked by disrespect for the legislative council and neglect of public opinions , certainly deserves moral reproof . under the principle of separation of powers , apart from playing a legislative role , members of the legislative council are duty - bound to serve as a watchdog of government policies and to reflect public opinions . the legislative council is the most representative of all the institutions within our system of representative government , and the members , be they returned by direct elections or functional constituency elections , all have considerable public support . for that reason , their opinions are a conglomeration of those of the public . constitutionally speaking , the executive and the legislature are , on the face of it , in a " checks - and - balances " type of relationship , although in reality ours is more an executive - led system . we respect this time - honoured executive - led system , but , at the same time , we are of the view that the government should respect the consensus of the majority of members of the legislative council . neglect of the legislative council , and therefore of public opinions , should never be the proper attitude adopted by an open and responsible government . the difference between an executive - led government and an executive dictatorship is indeed very subtle . the issues of the rating and the employment ( amendment ) bill have clearly demonstrated the government 's totalitarian nature beyond any question . i have served in the legislative council for 27 months . at one time during this period , the government went to great lengths to boost the status and esteem of this council . the reason was that the governor wanted to rally the support of this council for his " 1995 political reform package " , and to use it as a counter in his negotiations with the chinese government . he also wanted to use this council as a chip in the confrontation with the chinese side . regrettably , except during this brief period of honeymoon , the government has turned a deaf ear to most of the opinions expressed by members . over the past 27 months , we have held over 100 motion debates on government policies . towards the motions carried by this council , the attitude displayed by the government has been one of rejecting in the main . rarely has it responded to our motions , and still less rarely has it ever implemented any of them . worse still , the government sometimes even regards the consensus of members as noise nuisance . for instance , on the issue of toll monitoring for the western harbour crossing , the government made some irresponsible remarks that " monitoring by the legislative council will scare off investors . " also , both the secretary for the treasury and the chief secretary have strongly attacked the well - intentioned criticisms made by this council to the government , making allegations that this council was trying to curry favour with the public at the expense of civil service morale . all this reflects the determination of government officials to maintain a " strong administration " . it also reveals that the governor and government officials in general still cannot outgrow the outdated " supremacy of the government " mentality . the community is moving ahead ; democratization is making progressive headway ; the public is making increasing demands . these are social realities . is it that the government has been unable to grasp these changes ? or , is it that it simply refuses to march with the times ? i think it is time the government reconsidered its position thoroughly . however , as the saying goes , " respect yourself if you want to be respected . " the government 's disrespect for the legislative council , though very much caused by a bureaucratic mentality , is also the inevitable result of the members ' behaviour in some respects . some members move motions just for the sake of moving ; propose amendments just for the sake of proposing ; and put questions just for the sake of putting . examples of this kind indeed abound . more often than not , apart from conducting arguments on the basis of ideological and standpoint differences , they often " direct their arguments at political parties , at individuals , but not at the issues in question " . some members speak to criticize their counterparts ; some speak to put on a political show ; some even speak for the publicity of election candidates . such behaviour completely deviates from the rational attitude one should adopt for discussion and arguments . the government is quick to take advantage of this and often uses the tactic of " drawing in one party and hitting out at another " in policy debates and passage of bills . it simply watches a fire from the other side of the river and tries to reap a third party profit . the legislative council has thus been reduced to a venue for city forum . and , government officials can " complete their tasks " simply by " watching with folded arms " . although legislative members come from different walks of life and thus represent different interests , when it comes to policy discussions , they should always remain objective and neutral , putting partisan conflicts and interests aside . their prime concern should always be the interests of the community at large . while opinions may vary , arguments must be objective and fair . only this positive attitude should be adopted when discussing issues and resolving problems . united , and we can prevent the government 's tactic of " drawing in one party and hitting out at another " from succeeding . mr president , in less than eight months , this council has moved twice to reprove the government . similar actions will certainly come one after another if the government refuses to review its position and continues to take the legislative council for a rubber - stamp . erosion of public confidence in and support for the government is bound to occur . therefore , to the government , i advise caution . mr president , these are my remarks . mrs selina chow : mr president , the liberal party has repeatedly discussed and deliberated over ms anna wu 's motion . it was not at all simple because there was pressure from all sides . finally , the liberal party did make a rational and correct decision . we think that the motion is worthy of our support . our party leader the honourable allen lee has stated the reasons clearly . i would like to give a detailed account of the factors which the liberal party has taken into consideration during the process of discussion leading to such a decision . we all know that the hong kong government does not have its own party in the legislative council to act as its convoy . as a result , bills proposed by the government will always be subjected to substantial amendments . all of us realize that under the principle of an executive - led government , the administration has the absolute power to withdraw a bill if , during the consultation period , it is amended to such an extent that it is completely different from the original one . this serves as a passive resistance on the government 's part when it has no alternatives . a recent example is the hong kong arts development council bill . during the process of examining the bill by the bills committee , the government had clearly set down the bottom line and pointed out that any unacceptable amendments would certainly lead to the withdrawal of the bill . i do not think such a move is intended to intimidate the members . rather , it might be a bottom line set down by the government from an administrative point of view . according to the current rules of game , i think it is understandable and acceptable for the government to exercise its power of withdrawal openly . as regards our present legislative council and constitutional arrangements , we can even say that such a move is fair and just . regrettably , during the second reading of the employment ( amendment ) bill on 14 december last year , the government had evidently dealt with the matter in an inappropriate manner and had aroused strong responses in society and the press . despite the previous experience and the fact that mr lau chin - shek had already notified us that he would move an amendment , the government did not even bother to do any lobbying work and explain to the members beforehand . it merely informed the members that the standing orders of the legislative council allow anybody who has proposed a bill to withdraw it . the government was just trying to pave the way for its most effective means . in addition , it had not shown any respect to the rules and traditions of this council . in fact , if we ask those colleagues who were present at that time , i guess they will all agree that the amendment motion might not be passed so easily if the government had done its part . i would now like to respond to mr james to 's remarks made just now . he thought that the government could have adopted the same method it used last time when mr lau chin - shek moved his first amendment to the bill . however , it did not do so because it had counted the votes . instead , the bill was not allowed to proceed to the third reading . however , i remember very clearly that the secretary for education and manpower had informed this council before the bill was put to a vote during the second reading that the government would withdraw the bill if it was not passed . but it was already too late when the government informed this council and its stance had caused us to react emotionally . mr president , i would like to comment on the government 's response to ms anna wu 's motion . since the motion is evidently unfavourable to the government , it is natural that the government should be dissatisfied with the motion and should have embarked on lobbying work vigorously . such a move to protect itself is expected and gives little cause for criticism . but the arguments which the government has put forward when lobbying are misleading . the liberal party has all along been in favour of the decisions and consensus of the labour advisory board ( lab ) . however , we think that the government has handled the issue of the employment ( amendment ) bill in an inappropriate manner . yet , it does not mean that the liberal party does not support the employers or the lab . we indeed hope the government will not make use of the employers again as a " scapegoat " and give a false impression that the legislative council and employers are in opposition to each other in order to protect itself and cover up the government 's faults . finally , i have to make it clear that while we support today 's motion , we are not conspiring , as some people have said , to change the present executive - led government into a legislative - led government . the liberal party is in favour of an executive - led government . this is why the liberal party requests the government to do all that an executive - led government should do . if the government has made any mistake , it should have the courage to admit and learn a lesson , it is only in this way then the government can earn trust and respect from the people . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . president : yes , mr to . mr james to : i wish to clarify my position and i feel that i have been misunderstood . president : so you wish to clarify your position and you feel that you have been misunderstood ? mr james to : mr president , i think that i have been misunderstood because i did not say that the government had not given any notice on the occasion of the second amendments made on 14 december . the government did give notice before the second reading . however , when the employment ( amendment ) bill was first tabled , the government did not withdraw the bill even after its second reading . however , on the second occasion , that is , on 14 december , the government withdrew the bill after the amendments had been carried . on the first occasion , there was no withdrawal and members were allowed to move the third reading , but on the second occasion , the whole bill was withdrawn . this was a self-contradictory move which showed that the government had made such a decision not really because it respected the labour advisory board . mr chim pui - chung : mr president , my comments on today 's motion is divided into three parts : firstly , the significance of this motion ; secondly , the authority of the administration ; and thirdly , my own feelings . the first part concerns moving the bill to the third reading on december 14 last year . as we all know , during its second reading , the bill was carried by just one more vote . even if the administration proceeded to the third reading of the bill , i dare say the bill would not be passed because members who would vote against the amendments had returned . anyway , it was not as mr james to said that the administration had counted the votes beforehand . i have been with this council for more than three years . i think as far as motions or bills in this council are concerned , what matters most is whether the administration respects or follows the decisions of this council . we often have motion debates and the administration only responds by saying that it has noted of our points of view . has any action been taken at all afterwards ? even if today 's motion is passed , in what way will the administration be affected ? this is a very important question that needs be addressed first and foremost . the second part concerns the authority of the administration . we understand that the administration doubtlessly has the authority to withdraw bills . it had stated beforehand that it would withdraw the bill if it were not passed in the way intended . if the bill were not withdrawn at that time , we would not have reached an agreement for $210 000 . the amount might amount to $230 000 . at least , the present agreement will not cast greater pressure on some employers . by withdrawing the bill , the administration has acknowledged defeat , but you still do not want to let it go . the administration has already proceeded with amendments so that most members representing various sectors might continue to add amendments so as to make the bill acceptable to all parties . what is wrong with that ? why are we being so nervous ? the administration has heeded well - meaning advices but you still force it to submit the bill , which , if submitted , would not be acceptable to all sectors . i think we should not play up this issue . i stated last time that i would respect every member 's decision , be it a decision to resign , or continue to stay in this council or not to participate in elections . people come and go all the time . would hong kong collapse just because somebody is leaving ? our former chief secretary , sir david ford , was once regarded as a " tiger " . he has gone , but has the legislative council collapsed ? would the administration collapse ? i think what we should do is to act rationally . do not worry , mr president . i am not going to criticize any particular member . i am just trying to give an example . i only want to say that the administration does have the authority . why do we want to reprove the administration when it has been defeated ? i originally thought that i should oppose the motion , but i have finally decided that i should abstain . the reason is that i do not know what the administration is doing . it says it is not afraid of being defeated but it wants to maintain its dignity despite defeat . the administration took us as expendables in this battle in which it had lost . thirdly , ms anna wu is an appointed member . she is not directly elected . the administration has appointed her to challenge itself . are there any backdoor deals between them ? are they trying to achieve certain goals , thereby challenging the executive - led government of hong kong and then bringing the challenge to the post - 1997 era so that the chinese government will in future find this challenge a burden in the administration of hong kong ? have all of you considered this possibility ? i hope ms wu would not mislead the public or members into believing that we now have more power , and if we now succeeded in reproving the administration , we might set up a difficult precedent for the post - 1997 government , which would have to respond to similar situations . this kind of sentiment is particularly widespread among the so - called " democrats " , who are in fact anti - china people . one must bear in mind that hong kong is not an independent state . articles 1 and 12 of the basic law clearly state that there is a central government . members and the people of hong kong should not be so naive . if the interests of the central government are challenged , it will not sacrifice its own interests . it will not allow regional interests to prevail over those of the central government . what we can hope for is to look after the interests of hong kong , conditional upon the interests of the central government having been secured . we may then make use of her laws and regulations to the best of our advantage . thus we may be in a better position to obtain more benefits for ourselves . in this way , both hong kong and the central government may exist in harmony . some may want to share the benefits enjoyed by the central government or even to place hong kong interests above those of the central government through the phrases of " hong kong people ruling hong kong " and " with a high degree of autonomy " . this is absolutely out of the question . mr president , i am prepared to tell the truth of the whole incident . the administration is making use of conflicts that exist among various sectors . it has not only created conflicts in the labour sector , it has also caused conflicts within the liberal party . unlike mr martin lee 's democratic party which has headed for a one - way road with no return , the liberal party is standing at a crossroad . it can make its choice from a number of options . is it the governor 's policy to create conflicts within the liberal party with a view to splitting it ? it is difficult to tell . i am now speaking as a believer in political conspiracy . the fact remains that we are probing into each other with a view to securing more votes . therefore we have good grounds to be suspicious and to carefully scrutinize the matter . nevertheless , i hope that every citizen in hong kong will not be misled into irrationality , whether or not they think that we members , including me , are arguing about facts or staging a show in this council . originally , i wanted to support the hong kong government by opposing the motion . now , it says that it wants to maintain its dignity despite the defeat , and that the administration in future will not carry out lobbying in such a manner . mr president , with these remarks , i will abstain from voting on the motion . dr conrad lam : mr president , i believe many hong kong people do not object to an executive - led government . yet , i am absolutely certain that most people would oppose an autocratic government . what the government did on that day , however , has removed any remnants of disguised democratic posture that it might have . that incident has revealed two things . first , will the hong kong government continue to adopt the attitude and tactics of a colonial government ? does the government have the determination to change and improve itself ? is it going to cast off such a burden ? second , the government indeed has set a dangerous precedent . in fact , many hong kong people worry about the question of whether hong kong will have a high level of autonomy after 1997 . if the government has set such a precedent , it will really cause their anxiety that the government can bully a fully - elected legislature into submission by invoking this precedent . therefore , i hope the government can consider the people 's concern seriously and formulate policies which can make people feel that the government is striving for improvement instead of being autocratic . i support ms anna wu 's motion . president : mr andrew wong , i have to interrupt you , though , in two minutes . mr andrew wong : mr president , i speak to support the honourable anna wu 's motion . i feel that many members have used rather strong language in speaking to support the motion , such as " dictatorial " , or " the system is totally unsound " , etc. my view is that basically it would be quite a big deal for the government to withdraw a bill unless it is against public interests , or it causes any obstruction to administration , or it has breached any international covenant . i think it is quite immature and unwise to take such a drastic action . for this reason , when i heard mr michael leung , secretary for education and manpower , said in his conclusion speech of the debate for the second reading that should the amendment motion of the honourable lau chin - shek be carried at the committee stage , he would withdraw the bill , i had then remarked that it was a shameful thing . this is because it is not worth it for the government to produce its trump card . the whole story is really a simple one . on 6 july , 1994 , the last meeting of the last legislative session , when the honourable lau chin - shek succeeded in amending the bill , the government did not choose to adjourn or withdraw the bill . it merely did not propose its third reading of the bill . later when someone proposed its third reading , the proposal was defeated . it could be that the government was considering the " withdrawal " move , but decided subsequently not to do so . it seems likely that the government had figured that it could not get enough vote counts , or simply it had not made any vote count at all . i have not tried to count it myself . however , i doubted whether the government was familiar with the standing orders at all . it is likely that on 14 december , the government was totally unfamiliar with the standing orders . this is because there were in fact two options for the government , one of which was to withdraw the bill and the other was to adjourn it . but why did it choose to have the bill withdrawn ? if the bill were to be adjourned , then there was the whole christmas holidays to make compromises . if this were the case at the last meeting of the 1993-94 legislative session , then there was the whole of the long summer holidays to make compromises at leisure . however , the government had not drawn any moral from the past exit by 14 december and had the bill withdrawn . in fact , the government could have adjourned the bill instead of withdrawing it . under these circumstances , i think the crux of the whole matter is not in whether there can be any mechanism within the system to withdraw a bill . as some members have put it , if your own bill was so amended that it was no longer recognizable , you would also want to have it withdrawn . of course it may not have too much bearing on the whole situation , as others can also propose one which is conceived afresh and it may be passed without any change . but , at least , it will not be some other bill that one is not intended to have at all , but which is passed in one 's own name . such a mechanism is acceptable . however , as the government , it should have some tolerance under these circumstances . in this case , it looks obvious that the government is politically immature , and it may also be that it is it not familiar with standing orders . this may be the kind of training or learning badly needed by a transitional government , and the best occasion to learn is probably in the assembly . 8.00 pm president : it is now eight o'clock and under standing order 8 (2) , this council should now adjourn . attorney general : mr president , with your consent , i move that standing order 8 (2) should be suspended so as to allow the council 's business this evening to be concluded . question proposed , put and agreed to . mr andrew wong : as to the question of the labour advisory board ( lab ) , members who belong to the liberal party , in supporting this motion , were still saying that the lab 's views should be respected , and that is i think where the crux of the matter lies . if it is a must that the views of the lab be respected , then the government would totally be blameless for what it has done . some members also pointed out that hong kong arts development council bill had been so amended that it was no longer recognizable , meaning that adding elected representation to the council might not be acceptable to the government . this is exactly where the crux of the matter lies . everybody speaks highly of the lab because it has elected representation . besides , it is considered most representative as it has not only had representatives from the employers ' side but also representatives from the employees ' side , and that is why its views should be respected . what if other advisory bodies also have elected representation ? does that mean we also have to respect their views and that the legislative council therefore cannot amend whatever agreements they have been reached by them ? this is the most important point . my opinion is that all advisory bodies or policy - making committees appointed by the government are accountable to the executive in the first place , and the executive in turn is accountable to the legislature . if the matter concerns legislation , then it is the responsibility the executive to introduce the relevant bill to the legislature in respect of any agreement reached at the lab or , for that matter , by any advisory body , whatever representativeness it might have , and the legislature has the right to amend it . we will amend the bill by virtue of our territory - wide popular representation . therefore , the question is not whether the decision of the lab should be respected but whether we think it is right or wrong . should the lab be raised to such a high status , other advisory bodies could also be raised to very high status , and the result would be that the legislative council is completely unable to ask the government to be accountable to it in future , and the accountability of such organizations as the kowloon canton railway corporation and the mass transit railway corporation to the legislature might diminish as a result . but my view is that they can be allowed to run independently and their operation will then be monitored by officials concerned , who in turn will be accountable to the legislature . the second point is the question of an executive - led government . it seems that members have overstated the seriousness of the matter as if the executive could become totalitarian . perhaps we may say that it is not totalitarian but it is exercising some kind of checks and balances . in fact , the conception of an executive - led government has been clearly explained in the governor 's policy address . the government is of course responsible for the administration , but we can negative on any policy we disagree with , which means it cannot be decided unilaterally by the executive . this is not a question of whether hong kong has a democracy or not . rather , we are talking about a parliamentary system . a parliamentary system plays the role of counterbalancing the government , and the government plays an active role in governing and administration . in regard to regulations and institutions , the government has been given flexibility or even privileges to introduce bills . therefore , it has all along been my opinion that this is the issue of an executive - motivated instead of an executive - led government . this is exactly where the spirit of the system lies . thirdly , it is about the relationship between the executive and the legislature . just now i have already said that it is one of checks and balances . as for the relationship between officials and members , we can refer basically to the systems adopted by britain , france and germany respectively . in the british way , officials must also be members of the parliament ; for the french , officials cannot also be members of parliament at the same time ; and in the german way , which is also what we adopted previously , both members and other people may be appointed as officials , but the crucial thing about it is that the executive must have the supporting or unopposing votes of over half of the members . the above three kinds of relationship are basically the relationships between the executive and the legislature . this time , it is merely an occasion when the government did not have all the odds to its favour . the government should not always say that what it does is in keeping with the standing orders . if it says so , the honourable anna wu 's motion also conforms to the standing orders , except that it requires our approval . the digital timer showed 0700 president : mr wong , i am sorry , time is up . attorney general : mr president , it is a pity that some honourable members have chosen to use strong language in their speeches today . when they criticized the administration for withdrawing the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 , i would have hoped that they would have considered the impact that there would have been on our system of consultation through advisory boards and committees , had we taken a different course of action . we need to see the wood for the trees . contrary to the allegations made by some honourable members , the administration did not withdraw this bill because we felt that our authority was being challenged , nor because we had little regard for the welfare of employees in hong kong . we withdrew the bill because we considered it essential that we should first consult the labour advisory board ( lab ) , the well - recognized and long - established advisory body on labour issues , on the substantial amendment that members had made to the original proposal on which the board had achieved a broad consensus . as honourable members know , the members of the lab are elected by employers and employees . because of their conflicting interests , any agreement reached in the board is inevitably a compromise that has been achieved through serious and often lengthy negotiations . the lab has an excellent record in reaching agreements on important labour issues . to ignore the views of the board , or to overturn its proposals lightly , would not only damage the credibility of the lab as a forum where a reasonable balance between employers ' and employees ' interests can be struck , but would also put our labour relations at risk . a harmonious relationship between employers and employees is an integral part of hong kong 's economic success . mr president , over the years , a number of amendments have been made to the employment ordinance . on every occasion , the administration has consulted , and obtained the agreement of the lab on the proposals before the amendment bill was submitted to this council . because bills committees were normally set up to study previous bills to amend the employment ordinance , the administration was always able to go back to the board for further consultation in the event that legislative council members disagreed with any proposed amendments . however , as has been pointed out , no bills committee was set up to examine the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 . we had no opportunity to consult the lab on amendments to the bill proposed by the honourable lau chin - shek . since these were substantially different from the broad consensus reached by the board , we would have failed in our duty had we allowed the bill as amended by him to be enacted . it has been suggested that the administration could have adjourned the debate on the bill rather than withdrawing it . but what would that achieve ? had that course been followed , we would have to reintroduce at third reading the same bill , that is , the bill as amended in committee . withdrawal of the bill enabled the administration to come forward with a new bill , as indeed it did . so withdrawal would give much greater flexibility . as the secretary for education and manpower has already assured this council , the sole purpose of withdrawing the bill last month was to enable the administration to consult the lab again on the important issues of severance payment and long service payment . this we did . the new package of improvements endorsed by the board was embodied in the employment ( amendment ) bill 1995 which was passed by this council last week . mr president , it is wrong to see our action in withdrawing the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 as a challenge to the rights of honourable members in this council . we simply exercised the power provided under standing order 52 of this council . this standing order explicitly allows the member in charge of a bill to withdraw or postpone a bill at the beginning of the proceedings on a bill at a sitting . a bill withdrawn , i stress that word , may subsequently be reintroduced in the same session as another bill with the same objects or with the same provisions as the one which has been withdrawn . we were surprised that members reacted so strongly to our action . although this action is unusual in hong kong , there are many examples in the united kingdom , on whose parliamentary practice ours is based , where the government withdrew bills when they had been significantly amended in committee . at no stage in this process did the administration intend any disrespect to the important role that this council plays in the law - making process , as has been suggested . on the contrary , we have always placed great weight on the views expressed by honourable members in this council , in bills committees and elsewhere . so i am naturally disappointed that some honourable members should seek to reprove the administration for the withdrawal of the employment ( amendment ) bill simply because we made the prudent decision to consult the recognized advisory body on labour issues before reverting back to this council , significantly with an improved package . we have never denied the constitutional right of honourable members to amend our legislative and expenditure proposals . the suggestion that the administration sees this council as a " rubber stamp " is simply wrong . this is a travesty of the truth . we know better than that . we know that we have no divine right to expect members to support our proposals automatically , and that it is up to us to persuade members that they are in the best interests of the people of hong kong . indeed , honourable members have on many occasions amended or rejected our proposals in the past . a recent example is the residential care homes ( elderly persons ) bill which was passed by this council on 12 october last . we supported the third reading of the bill , even though it contained a committee stage amendment which we had opposed . mr president , it is however true that the administration and the members of this council have different roles to play and different spheres of responsibility in the law - making process . this is an executive - led government . when the administration considers policy issues , our prime concern is the overall interest of hong kong . this may , on certain occasions , mean that some sectional interests advocated or represented by honourable members cannot be fully satisfied . it is no disrespect to this council to say that we cannot afford to allow sectional interests to be put above the overall interests of hong kong . the fact that on a few occasions , other considerations do not allow us to accept the views of the legislative council does not in any way undermine the role of this council in the law - making process . the fact that the administration decides to withdraw a proposal does not mean that there can be no further discussion on it . on the contrary , in the case of the employment ( amendment ) bill , we made great efforts to refine and improve our package . if we were practising some form of " dictatorship " , as alleged by some honourable members , we would surely not bother to go to such trouble . to conclude , mr president , the administration recognizes that important role played by members of this council . we have paid , and will continue to pay , respect to this role , and to the right of honourable members to interpret it as they wish . but we too have a role to play , and i hope that members will in turn respect that role , and our right to interpret it in the way that we believe is in the best interests of the people of hong kong as a whole . that is surely the best way to maintain the public 's confidence in this council and in the entire system of government in hong kong . with these remarks , i urge honourable members to vote against this motion . mrs selina chow : mr president . president : yes , mrs chow . mrs selina chow : can i ask for a clarification ? president : are you prepared to elucidate , in fact , attorney general ? perhaps the question first . mrs selina chow : the attorney general referred to standing order 52 which states that " the member in charge of a bill may , at the beginning of the proceedings on a bill at a sitting , announce that he withdraws or postpones the bill " . but at the sitting of 14 december , in fact , the secretary for education and manpower withdrew the bill after the bill had been voted on . is that in contravention to standing order 52 ? president : that is a matter for me , mrs chow , not a matter for the attorney general . mrs selina chow : mr president , because the attorney general referred to that particular part in his speech . i was just wondering whether you would allow clarification . president : i would have ruled against the withdrawal if it was contrary to standing orders . it is for me to interpret . president : ms anna wu , you are now entitled to reply and you have four minutes 37 seconds out of your original 15 minutes . ms anna wu : mr president , i believe it is necessary and important that a collective protest be registered against the government . to hold the legislature hostage is not something that this council should allow or permit . the government , by doing so , effectively imposed a ceiling on what the legislative council can do or cannot do , can say or cannot say . if the government is saying that it would only accept suggestions that it agrees with , then there is no point in having accountability by the executive to the legislative council or in having a system of checks and balance . what is saddening is the fact that , despite the powers and authority of the executive - led government , it should choose to use heavy - handedness and attempt to scuttle a process of amendment , which forms the heart of the legislative council work . it is also saddening that , despite the achievements of the government , it should lack the confidence to engage legislative council members during the legislative process , but should instead choose to obstruct and deny the existence of the legislative council . members have expressed views that the executive must remain strong . but it is strong . it initiates bills . it sets policies . it decides on the budget . it has the ability to postpone and withhold money bills being laid before this council indefinitely . mr ip talked about the checks and balances between the executive and the legislature as if the executive branch is the weaker party . i am surprised . the checks and balances is a formula provided to the legislature constitutionally to be used on the executive branch because it is an executive - led government , not the other way around . the fact that it came back with an improved bill meant that the executive admitted that it could do better , but only under extreme pressure and embarrassment . this is not a debate about not respecting the labour advisory board . if the attorney general was suggesting that disagreement between the legislative council and the executive represents a difference in terms of sectional interests , i beg to differ . his statement reflected the practice by government of selective and manipulative consultation . i am surprised also to hear that the attorney general did not expect the council to react the way it did upon the withdrawal of the bill . it seems to me that there is a real departure and a real difference in terms of political perspectives between the legislature and the executive , and the government is far removed from the political reality of the day . i was asked by members as to whether or not we have any democratic process in hong kong . my answer is simple : of course we do not have any democratic process , but we all would like to have it . and in the course of evolvement into a democratic process , we would like to have a government that would respect the checks and balances and the constitutional role that exists in hong kong today . miss lau queried the suggestion of allowing a private member 's bill to be introduced immediately . this is a very limited measure to expedite the introduction of a private member 's bill . it does not remove the need for executive consent where money bills are involved and , given the situation faced by the employment ( amendment ) bill 1994 , where the original bill and all amendments have been fully vetted , there would have been no unfair advantage gained by anyone . it is in those circumstances that this is proposed for consideration . i am not aware of any previous case where the government has withdrawn a bill as a result of amendments made at committee stage . this is the rule hitherto observed by the government . i see no reason why the government should have withdrawn the bill in the manner that it did . this was a departure from the long - standing convention of the legislative council . mr president , i cannot ask for a compliment higher than that paid to me by mr chim . i am an appointee of the current administration . i am not obliged to support its position . this is the spirit of the legislative council , and this is something that the government should respect . thank you , mr president . question on the motion put . voice vote taken . the president said he thought the " ayes " had it . miss emily lau : i claim a division . president : council will proceed to a division . president : would members please proceed to vote ? president : are there any queries ? if not , the result will now be displayed . mr allen lee , mrs selina chow , mr hui yin -

" i have given the matter much thought . questioning other members ' sincerity in the support of democracy is , in my opinion , an expression of the opinion of that particular member and can hardly be regarded as out of place in a debate in a political forum like this legislature . as mr ho did not use offensive and insulting language in his speech , i rule that he did not breach standing orders . addresses report of the public accounts committee on report no . 26 of the director of audit on the results of value for money audits ( june 1996 - pac report no . 26 ) mr eric li : mr president , on behalf of the public accounts committee ( pac ) , i have the honour to table our report no . 26 today . the director of audit 's report no . 26 on the results of value for money audits completed between october 1995 and february 1996 was tabled in this council on 24 april 1996 . following discussion , the pac decided to carry out in - depth investigation into 11 subject matters raised therein . the report tabled today contains the conclusions and recommendations that the pac have reached on these matters . mr president , it is not my intention this afternoon to go over the conclusions and recommendations of our committee on all the 11 items . however , it is appropriate that i highlight some of our main concerns and recommendations . first , the committee feel perturbed that the administration does not seem to have learnt any lesson from the past . in the pac report no . 19 published in january 1993 , we expressed concern , after hearing evidence on the audit report on " reprovisioning of ferry piers in kwun tong " , that the administration had failed to include information on the expected length of the future usage of the piers in the submission to the finance committee seeking funding approval for the reprovisioning . at that time , the committee urged the administration to ensure that , in future , all important and relevant information should be included in the submissions to the finance committee when seeking funding approval . the administration , in the government minutes tabled in this council on 5 may 1993 , stated that it would ensure that in future all such information would be included in submissions to the finance committee . however , our examination has revealed that the administration has repeated the same failure when they sought funds on 11 june 1993 for the northcote college of education improvement project . the finance committee approved funding for the project at an estimated cost of $19 million , without knowing that it would only have a useful life span of two years ! i would strongly remind those government officials responsible to take heed of their promises to the pac so as to avoid the possibility of leading the finance committee into ill - informed decisions . the committee considers it imperative that the administration should provide the finance committee with sufficient and all relevant information , including the useful life span of a short - lived capital project , when seeking funding approval . we are also concerned to find that the housing department 's squatter control teams have maintained an excessive level of staff for a long period of time despite the marked decrease in squatting activities in recent years . in sharp contrast , the department of health has an acute shortage of pharmacist inspectors to monitor the sale and supply of controlled drugs , and the customs and excise department also suffers from a similar problem of having insufficient assistant trade control officers , to clear the backlog of consignment check cases on textiles licences and notifications . the committee therefore strongly urges the administration to keep a vigilant eye on the staffing level in various departments in the light of material changes in the services required to ensure that scarce resources are best utilized in dealing with more prevailing social issues . a further issue raised in the director of audit 's report relates to three capital works projects at the kai tak airport which did not follow the normal funding arrangements for government capital works projects . these projects bypassed the government mechanism for financial control and proper accounting and circumvented the necessary financial control by this council through the finance committee . we appreciate that , according to the public finance ordinance , the financial secretary has the power to decide what constitutes a public works project and that , in very exceptional circumstances , policy branches and departments may exercise flexibility in fast - tracking the normal procedures for well - defined , urgent and special capital works projects . we nevertheless consider it imperative that the approval of the finance committee must still be obtained before the commencement of the works . this is proper in order to uphold the legislative control of public finance and public accountability . we would also like to express our observation that there is room for improvement in the government 's system in awarding public works project contracts , particularly to those tenderers with significant adverse performance records . we have evidence that delays in the completion of projects have been caused and additional costs incurred because of the tenderers ' unsatisfactory performance . we also consider that contracts which stipulate restrictions of works or other requirements should be fully justified in order to avoid incurring unnecessary expenditure . we note from the director of audit 's report that in one of the reported contracts placing restrictions of work during the swimming season , whereby the contractor had to concentrate work in certain areas and at certain times of the year , created an uneven workload and added the cost by 15% to 20% ( roughly between $6.9 million and $9.2 million ) . however , value for money was not achieved because the restrictions had not been strictly enforced , and the contractor had , in many instances , been allowed to work during the restricted periods . the committee are of the view that both the central tender board and the relevant departments have an important role to play in screening out contract terms with unnecessary costly restrictions . the committee have worked very hard in the last two and a half months with the full co-operation of the administration . in particular , i owe my thanks to all members of the pac for their contributions and the director of audit for the assistance that he and his staff have rendered to the committee . i also wish to express my sincere appreciation of the dedicated support given by the secretariat staff , and of the wise counsel from our always dependable legal advisers . thank you , mr president . enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the labour disputes involving imported workers under the special labour importation scheme for the airport core programme projects and related issues mr lau chin - shek : the panel on manpower decided in december last year to conduct an enquiry into the labour disputes involving imported workers and related issues at the new airport work sites between september and november . the legislative council passed a resolution on 13 december 1995 authorizing the panel to exercise the powers under the legislative council ( powers and privileges ) ordinance to summon witnesses and documents for the purpose of the hearings . the enquiry has now been completed and i submit today , on behalf of the panel , the enquiry report . in conducting the hearings , the panel focused its attention mainly on the process of labour importation under the special labour importation scheme ( the scheme ) . that was why in the course of the hearings , we summoned witnesses who could provide the relevant information from different angles and in different aspects so as to assist the panel to understand objectively the reasons behind the strike staged by the 2 500 imported workers . we also tried to find some solutions to various problems . thirty - four witnesses were summoned to testify before the panel between january and june . they included representatives of the government and the hong kong airport authority , general contractors and subcontractors who took part in the airport core programme projects , representatives of the management service company that acted as a " middleman " in the recruitment of workers , and imported workers from thailand and china . the panel had the impression that in launching the scheme the government mainly aimed at ensuring the completion of the new airport projects on time . it did not try its best to accord priority to local workers so that they could benefit from the job opportunities brought about by the new airport projects . owing to the poorly worked - out details in the implementation of the scheme and the imperfect regulatory mechanism , the scheme was widely abused . what came as a shock to the panel was that the government was early aware of the malpractices but dealt with the matter in a low - key manner . as a result , the problem deteriorated . the panel opined that malpractice existed mainly because there was a lack of checks and balances in the regulatory mechanism . government departments adopted a " co-operative " approach to enable most contractors who wanted quotas to get all the quotas they wanted . with large quotas available to them , contractors could recruit imported labour at low wages without having to recruit local workers . in its report , the panel made a number of proposals for improving the approval mechanism . these include : - separation of the new airport projects co-ordination office from the approving departments so that the accountability of the office is enhanced and the approval process made more rigorous ; - review of the existing work relationship between government departments and definition of the responsibilities of the secretary for education and manpower and the director of immigration in relation to the regulation and implementation of the scheme ; and - transferring the power of quota approval to an administrative department to relieve the secretary for education and manpower of his daily work on quotas so that he can be more objective in his regulatory role . in addition to the above recommendations , the panel also had the worry that the government might ignore workers ' interests by unnecessarily importing labour just to achieve early completion of the new airport . the panel was of the view that an independent committee should be set up to advise the relevant policy secretary on labour importation policy and matters relating to the implementation of labour importation schemes . this independent committee should also be required to make decisions on whether labour importation should be continued , and if so it should ensure that the interests of local workers are not prejudiced . it can be shown that there has always been a considerable number of local workers working at the sites of the new airport , amounting to 80% of the total work force there . this tells us that from the very beginning , the authorities concerned had overestimated the difficulty in recruiting local workers to work in the airport core programme projects and had failed to grasp the actual progress of the work . the panel suggested that the administration should not set an upper limit for quotas that are not subject to a time limit . it should , instead , take various opinions into account , including actual labour demand for the construction projects , to decide a quarterly upper limit that may be higher or lower than the previous one and review such upper limit every six months . furthermore , the panel thought malpractice should be eradicated , such as the offer of substantially favourable terms to contractors by the " middleman " in exchange for the appointment as the recruitment agent and subsequent monetary advantages from imported workers so recruited . such malpractice has undermined the wages imported labour deserve , and at the same time affected the job opportunities of local workers . in this connection , the panel recommends that the knowledge of foreign workers on the conditions of service in hong kong should be enhanced , foreign workers should be requested to produce documents in support of their work experience and skills , existing laws to regulate " middleman " activities should be reviewed , the effectiveness of inspection by labour inspectors on work sites should be enhanced and prosecution actions should be stepped up . the panel also suggests that the government should as soon as possible consider cost - recovery by recovering administrative costs from contractors who apply for quotas . it is also our wish that the government will have better communication with labour exporting countries to jointly find solutions to problems , strengthen its regulation on the activities of agents and the fees they charge to ensure contractors will not import cheap labour through the scheme and thereby affect the job opportunities of local workers . in summary , the panel was very disappointed with the government , which promised to give local workers priority in job placement when labour was imported to satisfy local demands for workers . in the course of the hearings , the panel discovered a lot of malpractices , which had existed for some time . the government was not entirely ignorant of the matter . this appalled the panel and the panel hopes the government can learn something from this incident . it should review the policy on and implementation of the whole scheme as soon as possible and adopt those recommendations made in the panel 's report . the panel will follow up on these recommendations . i should record our special thanks here to the staff of the legislative council secretariat , in particular to miss pauline ng and the legal adviser and all those who assisted the panel in the hearings . thank you , mr president . hong kong airport authority annual report 1995-1996 financial secretary : mr president , under section 32 (5) of the airport authority ordinance ( aao ) , i now present to this council the hong kong airport authority annual report 1995-96 and the auditor 's report on the airport authority ( aa ) for the year ended 31 march 1996 . this is the first aa annual report , and it also covers the work of the provisional airport authority ( paa ) before the provisional body was reconstituted as the aa on 1 december 1995 . members will note from the annual report that substantial progress has been made by the aa over the year . the construction project of the new airport has been going on as scheduled and within budget . after the aao took effect on 1 december 1995 , the aa concluded and signed the financial support agreement and documents for land grant with the government . it also successfully concluded its first borrowing arrangement with outside institutions , the amount is $8.2 billion . also , the aa awarded a number of major franchises including air freight , aircraft catering and fuel supply services , and the franchises for aircraft maintenance and apron services will soon be awarded , too . all these outstanding achievements are attributable to the persistent efforts and full commitment of all the members of the aa board , the management and staff . i take this opportunity to thank them all . of course , i am also very grateful to members for their full support of the new airport project . members have recently approved the funding for the necessary government facilities to support the operation of the second runway of the new airport . i wish to express my gratitude especially to mr wong po - yan , chairman of the aa . mr wong took up the new responsibilities as chairman of the aa on 1 december 1995 when the paa was reconstituted as the aa . as the chairman of the aa , his responsibilities are arduous and important . i take this opportunity to thank mr wong po - yan for his full commitment to the job , especially for the great efforts he has made in hong kong 's interest , which will take us to the early commissioning of the second runway of the new airport . as soon as the second runway is commissioned , the new airport will further secure hong kong 's status as a major centre of aviation , trade , financial services and tourism . i am confident that the authority will carry on with the good work in the years to come . the new airport in chek lap kok will prove to be an excellent investment for hong kong and the pride of hong kong people . thank you , mr president . oral answers to questions president : as we are set for a long sitting today , i will keep question time to around one hour . members should keep their supplementary questions short , avoiding long , argumentative and repetitious preambles and multi-barrelled questions . visa - free stay for chinese visitors 1. mr howard young : mr president , there has been a rapid increase in the number of people 's republic of china ( prc ) passport holders visiting the territory on transit which benefits hong kong 's tourism industry . in this connection , will the government inform this council whether such holders are allowed to visit macau and re-enter hong kong within the seven day visa - free period and whether , on re-entering from macau , they may be granted an additional visa - free period in excess of the original seven day visa - free period ; if so , whether there are any measures to encourage tourism on the one hand and avoid the system being used to prolong overstaying unnecessarily on the other ? secretary for security : mr president , with effect from 1 august 1993 , prc nationals transiting through hong kong to or from overseas countries are allowed a visa - free stay of up to seven days as visitors provided that they have valid passports , confirmed airline bookings and valid visas for their overseas destinations . the purpose of this arrangement is to facilitate their overseas travel by connecting flights in hong kong or stopping over here before returning to china . this transit facility is however not allowed for journeys from china to macau since prc nationals in china can go to macau direct . prc nationals are expected to adhere to their travel plans and not to make side trips to other places , including macau , when transiting through hong kong . however , immigration officers have no power to stop any visitor or transit passenger from departing to a place other than their intended final destinations . but if they return to hong kong from a side trip , they will have to explain to the satisfaction of the immigration officers that they indeed have reasons to deviate from their original travel plans . depending on individual case merits , they may be landed for a few days to complete their previous seven days ' stay . further change of plans by using the same method ( that is , by leaving for macau and return to hong kong again ) will come under close scrutiny . on the other hand , if a transittee 's case does not justify , he / she may be refused permission to land in hong kong . at present , we have no plan to relax the visa - free arrangement to allow prc nationals to transit through hong kong to macau . such a relaxation will invite abuses to bypass the existing schemes controlling prc nationals visiting hong kong . mr howard young : mr president , visitors from china have numerically topped the list of visitors in hong kong and i believe that they spend over $10 billion in hong kong . like the close to 10 million other visitors , they usually spend several days here and go to macau for one or two days before returning to hong kong . i would like to ask the secretary for security whether the government will consider , instead of depending on individual case merits only , to allow the chinese visitors to enjoy their remaining visa - free stay after leaving hong kong for a short time as long as they are really transitting hong kong and have yet to spend all the seven - day visa - free period . secretary for security : mr president , if these people just leave hong kong for macau for one or half a day and would not overstay the seven - day period , we will deal with them in a more relaxed way . but what we are concerned is that we must scrutinize whether they are merely transitting and the ultimate destination is a foreign country . mr james to : mr president , the first paragraph of the secretary 's main reply is in fact logically refutable because if we say they can go to macau from china directly , they can also go to thailand or any other places in the world from china directly , and do not have to go through the hong kong airport . therefore , there is a logical contradiction in this concept . nevertheless , my question is on the point in the last paragraph of the main reply where the secretary said that in so doing , the system would be abused . however , if they only go to macau for one or two days during that period and then come back to hong kong and they can produce proof that they will go back to china , i wonder what security significance is there that the authorities have to refuse their entry to hong kong or put them under close scrutiny . mr president , my question is on security significance . secretary for security : mr president , we have the responsibility to control the entry and exit of prc nationals in hong kong and we do not want too many people to abuse this system and give them the opportunity to take advantage of this system to remain in hong kong . therefore , we have to take the said measure . president : mr james to , are you claiming that your question has not been answered ? mr james to : yes , mr president , i want to ask why in this way they will then remain here . will the secretary explain in detail the security significance ? secretary for security : in answering the honourable howard young 's question just now , i have mentioned that the policy is to allow those people to stay in hong kong for not more than seven days . with such a policy premise , if we feel that someone changes the itinerary to go to macau for one or half a day and then return to hong kong without overstaying the seven - day period , we will deal with that in a more relaxed manner . this is our way of handling it . but on the other hand , we have to make sure that not too many people do so . they may not really want to go to other countries but only go to macau via hong kong . we do not wish to see anyone abusing this system . mr chim pui - chung : mr president , the secretary emphasized in her main reply that if the visitors have other destinations , they may go to macau during their seven - day stay but the immigration department has the power to scrutinize them . can we request the government to consider making it a policy that if it can be proved that they will go to other countries and that they only go to macau for one , two or even three days but not more than seven days within their seven - day stay , then they do not need the approval of the immigration department but that it will be their right to decide so as to promote the tourism industry in hong kong ? secretary for security : mr president , we are very willing to review the existing policy . if we have reason to believe that there is a need to make it a policy without examining and approving it case by case , we will certainly consider it . but for now , we feel that some people have abused this system . although there are not many of such cases , i can provide members with some statistics for reference . during the period from january to june 1996 , we found 39 abuses of this system and refused the offenders entry . mr howard young : mr president , 39 out of 2 million a year is a very small proportion . when reviewing the policy , will the government consider surveying visitors from other places in the world who have a limited stay in hong kong for travelling or business activities to see if these people would go to macau for one or two days and see if the government will normally allow them to continue enjoying the rest of their original stay or the government has to approve them depending on individual case merits and then see if the chinese nationals should receive the same treatment ? secretary for security : when we examine the operation of the policy , we will at the same time consider all relevant information , including the points just raised by mr young . president : are there two million chinese nationals transiting hong kong for foreign destinations per annum ? was that a point made by you , mr young ? mr howard young : no , mr president , i did not say there were two million transit passengers . there are two million visiting and transiting hong kong . mr james to : some hong kong people may find it faster to go to zhongshan via macau than to go directly to china . similarly , if the chinese nationals from our neighbouring shenzhen want to go to macau , they may think that it is better to go there via hong kong . should this policy give a comprehensive consideration to the convenience of people in several places ? besides , as there is no freedom of exit in china , if chinese nationals are allowed to leave the country , they have in fact undergone a rather close scrutiny ; therefore , will the government review this policy , considering also the fact that there have only been 39 abuse cases ? secretary for security : i have already said that we can review the policy . mr president , may i show members a figure ? the figure that mr howard young just cited is not correct , that is , the number of transit passengers . according to our statistics , the number of such transit passengers was 330 000 in 1995 . five - year plan for arts development 2. mrs elizabeth wong asked : mr president , will the government inform this council whether it has any knowledge of the timing for the implementation of the five - year plan for arts development drawn up by the arts development council ? secretary for broadcasting , culture and sport : mr president , the hong kong arts development council 's five - year strategic plan , which sets out the blueprint for the development of the arts in hong kong for the period from the year 1996-97 to the year 2000-01 , was drawn up in december last year . in the strategic plan , the council has identified 74 key tasks under four broad goals , namely , access , excellence , resources and advocacy . in order to carry out these tasks , the council has proposed 292 action steps to be implemented during the five - year period ending 2001 . the council began to implement the five - year strategic plan on 1 april 1996 . to date , the council has commenced implementing 59 of the 74 key tasks , and 157 of the 292 action steps . mrs elizabeth wong : mr president , could the secretary elucidate or elaborate on which 59 of the 74 key tasks and which 157 of the 292 action steps have in fact commenced implementation ? if not today , i would be very happy to wait for a written reply . secretary for broadcasting culture and sport : mr president , i would be very happy to provide mrs wong with the details that she has asked for in this question , in writing . ( annex i ) mr andrew cheng : mr president , it is of paramount importance for the government to provide sufficient funding if the five - year strategic plan is to be implemented . it was mentioned in the main reply that there were 135 action steps that had not yet commenced implementation . however , the government has allocated only some $56 million to the arts development council for the year 1996-97 . this level of allocation is far short of the council 's budgeted expenditure of more than $90 million for 1996-97 . will the government tell us , with financial resources of that size , how can the five - year strategic plan be implemented ? is the government confident that the plan can be implemented and can the secretary give us a concrete timetable for such implementation ? secretary for broadcasting , culture and sport : mr president , our information shows that the council 's proposed expenditure for 1996-97 is $140 million . this sum can be fully met by the recurrent subvention allocated by the government for the current year and by the capital grant of seed money to the council . in view of this , we feel that the implementation of the plan should not be affected in terms of the timetable . in regard to the proposals contained in the strategic plan for the succeeding years , we are striving to do our best to seek the resources necessary for the council 's implementation of its five - year strategic plan . emergency medical treatment for non-hong kong residents 3. mr cheung hon - chung asked : will the government inform this council : ( a ) whether non-hong kong residents can receive treatment in the casualty departments of public hospitals in the territory ; if so , how the relevant charges are collected from such persons ; in case of default , what actions are taken to recover the arrears from such persons , and what the results of such actions are ; and ( b ) whether it has signed agreement with any countries and regions which will enable residents of these territories to receive free emergency medical treatment in each other 's territory on a reciprocal basis ; if so , what the details are ; if not , why not ? secretary for health and welfare : mr president , in keeping with our policy that no one should be prevented from obtaining adequate medical treatment due to lack of means , accident and emergency services are provided free of charge by the hospital authority and the department of health , except in the case of one ex-subvented hospital where a nominal fee of $34 for hong kong residents and $175 for overseas visitors is imposed for historical reasons . action is being taken to standardize the practice across all public hospitals . the only country with which hong kong has a reciprocal agreement on medical treatment is the united kingdom . the agreement has been in place since 1 april 1982 and took the form of a formal exchange of letters between the british and hong kong governments . from what we know , this arrangement was initiated when the united kingdom announced a new legislation in 1982 which imposed new charges on overseas visitors for access to medical and dental treatment under the national health service . under the existing agreement , all hong kong residents are eligible for free access to the national health service , including accident and emergency treatment . similarly , united kingdom citizens may receive a full range of medical treatment in hong kong at the same subsidized rate as local residents . the term " hong kong resident " is defined as any person who is ordinarily resident in hong kong and who holds a valid identity card , passport or certificate of identity issued by the hong kong immigration department or who is the spouse or dependent child under 18 years of age of such a person , while " united kingdom citizen " means any person who is ordinarily resident in the united kingdom and who holds a national health service medical card . mr cheung hon - chung : mr president , at present , a large number of hong kong residents go to china every day , and there were reports that hong kong residents had had unhappy incidents when they sought medical services in mainland china . can the secretary inform this council that apart from asking hong kong citizens to take out insurance , will she discuss with the chinese government with a view to reaching a medical and health agreement similar to the one hong kong has reached with the united kingdom ? secretary for health and welfare : mr president , we do not intend to do so at present , this is because if a reciprocal agreement is to be reached , we have to take into account that the medical systems of both places ought to be at a certain level , and that the services provided by both places also have to be at a certain level , and it must be ensured that our residents will receive suitable care at the other place . for these reasons , as we cannot be sure that these conditions are met , we do not intend to take the initiative to propose to other countries for such reciprocal agreements . mr bruce liu : mr president , in the first paragraph of the government 's main reply , it is said that it is the government 's policy that no one should be prevented from obtaining adequate medical treatment due to lack of means , and this also includes accident and emergency services provided free of charge for the public . will the secretary inform this council whether the terms " no one " and " the public " refer , apart from hong kong people , also to people that are not hong kong residents , for example , visitors from mainland china ? in other words , is it the case that all hospitals under the hospital authority will not , as a matter of policy , refuse the request to provide emergency services ? will the administration investigate into any move that are not in keeping with this policy ? president : i take the two to be two parts of one single supplementary . secretary for health and welfare : mr president , the current practice in hong kong is that for all people , be they hong kong residents or overseas visitors in hong kong , whenever they have the acute disease and need to seek medical consultation at the emergency units of public hospitals , we will not charge them anything , and the services are provided free of charge . mr cheung hon - chung : mr president , i wish to ask a supplementary . will the secretary inform this council whether or not the agreement hong kong signed with the british government will become invalid after the sovereignty of hong kong is returned to china ? secretary for health and welfare : mr president , could you ask the honourable member to repeat his question ? president : the reciprocal agreement with the united kingdom , will it become invalid in july 1997 ? secretary for health and welfare : mr president , this agreement was signed between hong kong and the united kingdom , and i believe it will not become invalid with time . remuneration and benefits of policy secretaries 4. miss emily lau : mr president , it has been reported that a member of the preparatory committee has suggested that the salaries of principal officials of the hong kong special administrative region government should be increased significantly . at present , the monthly salary of a policy secretary at d8 of the directorate pay scale is $157,250 . but this amount has since changed to $169,350 because approval has been given by the finance committee of this council for the salary adjustment . president : miss emily lau , you are not supposed to add words to the original question . miss emily lau : thank you , mr president . i only wanted to provide some new information . president : miss lau , or else the secretary cannot really answer it . you can bring in the words when you ask your supplementary . miss emily lau : its total remuneration package inclusive of other benefits amounts to almost $300,000 a month . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the criteria for determining the remuneration and benefits of policy secretaries ; ( b ) how the remuneration and benefits of policy secretaries compare to those of senior executives at comparable levels in the private sector ; ( c ) whether the senior non-expatriate officers association has made a request for improving the remuneration and benefits of policy secretaries ; and ( d ) whether it has any plan to review the remuneration and conditions of service of policy secretaries ? secretary for the civil service : mr president , i shall answer the points seriatim . ( a ) our policy and objective on civil service remuneration is to offer sufficient remuneration to attract , retain and motivate staff of a suitable calibre to provide the public with an effective and efficient service . such remuneration should be regarded as fair both by civil servants and by the public which they serve . within these parameters , broad comparability with the private sector is an important factor in setting civil service pay . with regard to policy secretaries , the administration accepts that while any reasonable assessment of fair remuneration for civil servants should make reference to corresponding commercial packages , top directorate packages may not match those of some top executives in the private sector , given the difference in the nature of the service . other than external relativities , we also need to take account of the responsibilities and hence remuneration of other officers on the directorate pay scale , that is , internal relativities . we have a number of grading factors we use to determine the classification of departments and their heads . taken from the tenth report of the standing committee on civil service salaries and conditions of service , these are attached to the printed version of my reply . a recommendation was made in the same report that policy secretaries should be remunerated at a higher pay point than the heads of the large civilian departments because of their clearly wider and heavier responsibilities . currently , heads of large civilian departments are remunerated at d7 and the policy secretaries are remunerated at d8 . ( b ) we have not collected any up - to - date information to compare the remuneration and benefits of policy secretaries to those of senior executives in the private sector lately . our practice has been for the annual directorate pay adjustments to follow those of the upper pay band and there should be periodic reviews to study whether directorate pay has fallen significantly out of step with changes in private sector pay . our last such review was done in 1989 . ( c ) the senior non-expatriate officers association has not made any such request . ( d ) at this stage , we have no plan to review the remuneration package of policy secretaries . appendix grading factors main factors a the importance of the department to hong kong , taking into account the economic or social effects on hong kong of good or bad decisions taken by the head of department , and of good or bad judgement exercised by him . b the financial effects or implications on government funds , having regard not only to the size of the funds controlled , but also to the difficulty of ensuring efficient control and the extent to which the head of department is in a position to vary revenue and expenditure by taking decisions and exercising judgement . c the difficulty of the decisions to be taken and the difficulty of the judgement to be exercised , having regard to the amount of planning and forecasting required , the amount of information and guidance available and the nature of the problems . d the time available in times of stress to take the decisions or assess the situation . e the difficulty of administering the department , taking into account its size , complexity and geographical location , and the variety and nature of its duties . f the political / social abilities required , taking into account the political , social and public relations duties of the head of department within hong kong or overseas . additional factors g the leadership required as regards staff , morale and man - management and the importance of these factors to the efficiency of the department . h the market value of the head of department outside the government service , taking into account his qualifications and experience and the demand for his services . i the personal responsibility of the head of department in addition to his normal duties as the head of his department . j the inter - relationship with other departments , taking into account the extent to which the department is called upon to advise other departments . miss emily lau : mr president , i am sorry i added some words . however , i need to make it clear that at present the monthly salary of a policy secretary stands at $169,350 , which is much more than $157,250 . the government 's reply is quite odd . on the one hand , it said there was broad compatibility between the public and private sectors in salary . on the other hand , it said salaries in the public sector might not match those in the private sector . so , the government was choosing whatever was helpful to advance its argument ! mr president , i want to ask about the periodic reviews . in fact , the secretary already amended his written answer . in the written answer it was said there " would " be periodic reviews , giving us the impression that there " would " be such reviews . the last of those took place in 1989 . but just now the secretary only said there " should " be reviews . in fact , i want to ask whether there will be any periodic reviews , since the last paragraph of the reply indicated the government had no plan to review . if the last review was done in 1989 , then when " should " the next one be ? is it being done periodically ? if it is , what is the interval between reviews ? the most important thing is : if salaries in the private sector are found to be lower probably because of salary reduction as a result of a poor market , as our honourable colleagues from the business sector might say , will the government reduce the salaries of its employees ? secretary for the civil service : mr president , if we could choose what we like , i believe we need to have at least a 40% increase in our salaries . yes , we did say there " should be " reviews . in principle , there should be . of course , in reality we need to take into consideration the actual circumstances in deciding when to conduct reviews . under the present circumstances , our judgement is that at the moment we do not have any plan to conduct a review . as regards the honourable miss emily lau 's second question about what would happen if salaries in the private sector were found to be lower , i should point out that this is a theoretical and hypothetical question . in reality , every review in the past showed that our salaries were way below those for top or chief executive level staff in the private sector . so , in fact that question does not exist at all . mr james tien : i do not agree with the government 's assertion that salaries of senior civil servants are far below those of private sector employees . paragraph 5 of the main reply mentioned that there was a pay review in 1989 . did the review cover only pay and allowances ? i asked this question because a rather harsh reality in the private sector is that employees may be dismissed for not performing well . civil servants never need to worry about this . they just resign voluntarily . how much is this " immunity from dismissal " treatment worth ? did the review consider this treatment enjoyed by civil servants ? secretary for the civil service : mr president , the question of job security was indeed recognized in the report of the standing committee on directorate salaries and conditions of service ( standing committee ) to be a factor that distinguishes civil servants from private sector employees . the 1989 review showed that in the four years between 1985 and 1989 salary adjustments for directorate grade civil servants fell behind those for employees in the private sector at a similar level by 28.5%, that was nearly 30%. the standing committee later proposed an adjustment of 4.3%, which could hardly bring the two close enough . so , in reality , i can safely say the present gap is wider , and not narrower . the honourable member asked about the monetary value of " dismissal " . i have answered that already . however , mr president , i cannot help taking up the point again , if you would allow me to do so . as policy secretaries , we are involved in other factors . we need to formulate policies , manage resources , face the public and take part in the work of the legislative council . we have to do battles on all fronts every day . ( laughter and applause ) i believe few employees at chief executive level in the private sector have to do this . thank you , mr president . president : as a member of the senior non-expatriate officers association , or a member of the administrative service , or as the government 's representative ? or all three rolled into one ? ( laughter ) miss emily lau : mr president , i am sorry , i do not think you should have asked that question . we should be the one to ask . if you want to ask , you should come down from your seat . ( laughter ) i believe in answering our questions mr lam woon - kwong is wearing the hat of the secretary for the civil service . he mentioned a short while ago that salaries for directorate grade civil servants were lower than employees at a similar level in the private sector by 30%. what kind of companies in the private sector was he referring to ? how was the comparison made ? his policy branch is very small but has a lot of responsibilities to shoulder . what kind of companies was compared with his policy branch so that he had the feeling that he had been treated unfairly and directorate grade staff were paid 30% less ? secretary for the civil service : mr president , i did not use the words " unfairly treated " . the survey conducted by the standing committee , like similar surveys we have been conducting , chose some of the good and sizable employers as subjects because their salary adjustments have been used for comparison as a matter of policy in government salary adjustments . of course , it would not be proper for me to mention the names of these companies , but they are all " blue chip " companies in hong kong . mr james tien : mr president , in the business community , if a chief executive makes mistakes , or the profit of his company falls , his bonus may be cut and he may be dismissed . certainly , the secretary said they needed to " do battles on all fronts " , but we in this council have seen them " shirking responsibilities " . and within each policy branch there are some 10 policy secretaries to assist . with so many people assisting , how much should their salaries be reduced ? secretary for the civil service : mr president , as an example , i am now " battling bravely " all by myself in the legislative council and no one can assist me . what i am trying to say is that just like any other chief executive , matters within the scope of the civil service branch are my responsibility and i need to deal with all of them . as such , the extent of responsibilities resting on my shoulders are no less than that on those of a chief executive in a large private concern . miss emily lau : mr president , has the government tried to compare itself with other governments ? i often say you secretaries have the highest salaries in the world . has the government got information about remuneration given by other governments to their top civil servants ? are they paid less than our top civil servants ? secretary for the civil service : mr president , we never tried to compare with other governments as it would not be appropriate . every region , every government should make reference to their economic development at home and what they can pay their employees . comparisons should be made within the region or country . that would be more appropriate . i believe members in this chamber would not try to make comparisons with members of the legislatures in other regions . japanese apology for war atrocities 5. mr tsang kin - shing : mr president , as the british rule over the territory will end on 30 june 1997 , will the government inform this council whether , prior to that date , the british government will demand that the japanese government formally apologize to the people of hong kong for the atrocities committed by the japanese army in the territory during the second world war , and make reparations in this regard ? secretary for security : mr president , we fully understand the strength of feeling on this issue . we note that former prime minister murayama made a statement of apology for japan 's wartime past in a speech on the vj ( victory in japan ) day anniversary last year . on the question of compensation , we confirm that the matter was referred to the british government for consideration when the matter was last raised in this council in december 1990 and november 1992 . the british government advised that the japanese government had fully discharged their obligations for compensation under the treaty of peace with japan signed by the united kingdom and other allied powers in san francisco in 1951 . it is therefore not open to the british government to raise the matter with the japanese government . mr tsang kin - shing : mr president , it was the british government that accepted the surrender of the japanese forces on behalf of the people of hong kong at that time . does the british government have the moral obligation to urge japan to apologize and compensate for their atrocities in the war ? will the british government do this ? since other countries in the asia pacific region , such as the philippines and south korea , can obtain compensation , why is it not the case for hong kong ? have the british discharged such responsibility , such obligation ? is this their obligation ? if britain does not pursue the matter this year , who will take up this responsibility subsequent to the british withdrawal ? considering the fact that hong kong was under the british rule during the three years and eight months of japanese occupation , who shall pursue the matter ? by what means can the people of hong kong pursue this matter ? president : it is a rhetorical question . mr yum sin - ling : mr president , a local magazine reported that an agreement was reached between the united nations and japan in march this year that if japan wanted to become a permanent member state of the united nations security council , it has to deal with , in the first place , the persistent demands for compensation from some countries . may i ask whether the hong kong government will take this opportunity to assist the people of hong kong to obtain compensation that they deserve ? secretary for security : mr president , as i have mentioned , the peace treaty of san francisco , which also applied to hong kong , made provisions for the allied states to dispose of japanese assets under their jurisdiction by way of war reparations . the british government and other allied powers agreed that the sums received would be recognized as a full discharge by the japanese government of its obligations . in other words , i am afraid , the scope for legal redress in seeking compensation is constrained by the san francisco peace treaty of 1951 . mr edward ho : mr president , the secretary said that under the 1951 peace treaty , the japanese government fulfilled its obligation for compensation . is it that all payment made as compensation had eventually gone to britain ? how much of the compensation was actually given to the people of hong kong to make up for their losses ? secretary for security : mr president , i do not have the facts and figures here . but i think the important thing is to say that on the question of a legal liability from the japanese government , that has been taken care of by the peace treaty of san francisco in 1951 . president : mr edward ho , are you claiming that your question has not been answered ? mr edward ho : can the secretary provide an answer in writing ? secretary for security : i shall try to dig up the information which i believe is many years old . so if the information is available , i shall be happy to provide it in writing . ( annex ii ) mr albert ho : mr president , in her reply just now the secretary made a reference to the treaty of san francisco under which japanese assets were frozen and disposed of for partial compensation . i have to point out that the amount was meagre . besides , the british government , without consulting the people of hong kong , gave up all compensation on behalf of hong kong . this is article 14 of the treaty of san francisco . mr president , my question is : now that the british government is to withdraw from hong kong soon , can it guarantee that all information which is still in the hands of the government , including those on japan 's atrocities in hong kong during the japanese occupation and those relating to the military aspects , and most importantly , those which has an impact on the people of hong kong , such as the information on the wartime currency will be made public or returned to the people of hong kong before 1 july 1997 ? secretary for security : mr president , i am not sure if the question falls within my ambit of responsibility which looks after security . so i think this is a question for the british government which i will have to take up with the relevant authorities . president : mr albert ho , are you claiming that your question has not been answered ? mr albert ho : mr president , in fact , the government still has a great deal of information which is classified . it is because as a matter of fact , i wrote to the government two or three years ago and the government stated that ...... president : mr albert ho , which part of your question has not been answered ? mr albert ho : i was simply asking whether the government was willing to guarantee that those information would be made public . if the secretary for security does not have the answer , can she provide it in writing afterwards ? president : the secretary has said that she will take the matter up with her majesty 's government . mr albert ho : mr president , the hong kong government does have those information . if the hong kong government still has the information , can it be disclosed ? certainly , the british government is also involved and we can approach it for clarification . but can those information in the hands of the hong kong government be made public ? secretary for security : mr president , i have said earlier that i will take this up with the relevant authorities . ( annex iii ) mr cheung man - kwong : mr president , it was mentioned in the main answer that the japanese government fully discharged their obligations for compensation . let us not talk about those chinese people whose families were destroyed and whose family members were killed during the war or those pitiable women who were forced to become " comfort women " . during the war of resistance against japanese invasion , a great many hong kong people were forced to exchange their money for the japanese wartime currency , which was completely nullified subsequent to the defeat of japan and consequently , all the assets of the people simply vanished . will the british government , prior to its withdrawal , assist those hong kong people who were forced to exchange their money for the wartime currency to have their wartime currency redeemed by the japanese government in an effort to return to the people their rightful assets ? secretary for security : mr president , while the hong kong government fully sympathizes with those who suffered loss and hardship in hong kong during the japanese occupation , the government cannot press the british government to further pursue with the japanese government on the matter of seeking compensation for those hong kong residents who are still holding japanese wartime currency . under the peace treaty with japan signed by the united kingdom and other allied powers in san francisco in 1951 , which also applied to hong kong , the sums received at the time will be recognized as the full discharge by the japanese government of its obligations . i do not think that we can change or rewind history . mr tsang kin - shing : mr president , just now i did not exceed the scope of the original question . i asked about moral obligations . obviously , a legal explanation has been made , but my feeling is that morally speaking , the british should assist the people of hong kong to demand an apology and compensation from japan . will they do so ? if they will , in what way will the assistance be provided ? president : mr tsang kin - shing , i did not rule your question out of order for exceeding the scope of the original question . i ruled it to be rhetorical , in other words , argumentative . you were making a point . i now accept your present supplementary . secretary for security : mr president , i would like to reiterate that we are very sympathetic to those who have suffered physically , mentally , emotionally and financially during the japanese occupation of hong kong . but i think the fact remains that i do not think that we are in the position to render assistance to them for the reasons i have just explained . as regards the moral obligation or whether her majesty 's government is going to pursue , i think it is for her majesty 's government to answer . president : mr tsang kin - shing , are you claiming that your question has not been answered . mr tsang kin - shing : yes , mr president . president : which part ? mr tsang kin - shing : the last part . president : secretary , perhaps i will rephrase the question on behalf of mr tsang kin - shing . is there any moral obligation on the part of the hong kong government to persuade the british government to do something about it ? secretary for security : i think that in seeking compensation , we may perhaps explore the moral route . but whether this would lead to anywhere , i do not have a crystal ball , i cannot have the answer . lawsuits under new territories land ( exemption ) ordinance 6. mr wong wai - yin : mr president , the new territories land ( exemption ) ordinance ( cap . 452 ) has been implemented for two years . in this connection , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the number of lawsuits filed under the ordinance over the past two years ; ( b ) the number of women in the above lawsuits who were successful in securing the right of succession to land in the new territories ; and ( c ) whether activities have been conducted to publicize the ordinance so as to ensure that women in the new territories have a clear understanding of their entitlements under the ordinance ; if so , the contents , timing and costs of such activities ? secretary for home affairs : mr president , the new territories land ( exemption ) ordinance provides for the application of the general laws of inheritance to land in the new territories , thereby safeguarding the equal rights for women to inherit land in the new territories . the ordinance takes effect in this regard from 24 june 1994 . there is no provision for filing lawsuits under the new territories land ( exemption ) ordinance . women who wish to inherit land in the new territories after the enactment of the ordinance have to apply for grants of probate or letters of administration under the general laws of inheritance . these laws include the probate and administration ordinance ( cap . 10 ) , the intestates ' estates ordinance ( cap . 73 ) and the inheritance ( provision for family and dependants ) ordinance ( cap . 481 ) . it is a matter entirely for the personal representatives of the deceased to apply for the appropriate grants of representation or to file lawsuits in case of disputes under the general laws of inheritance . the probate registry does not keep statistics of cases by ordinance , and the court registries classify lawsuits according to their nature , such as personal injuries , bankruptcy , companies winding - up , probate , divorce , admiralty , and so on . there is no distinction made of individual women who derive their rights of inheritance to land from the new territories land ( exemption ) ordinance . we therefore do not have statistics on the number of women who have successfully inherited land as a result of the enactment of the ordinance . regarding publicity , the provisions of the new territories land ( exemption ) ordinance were extensively publicized after their enactment . publicity leaflets explaining the purpose and key features of the ordinance were distributed widely through district offices , rural committees and the housing department . a special civic education programme which focused particularly on the rights of women under this ordinance was produced and shown on television . liaison officers at the new territories district offices also explained the relevant provisions to villagers during their regular visits . the above activities were part of the on - going liaison and public education services provided by the home affairs branch and the home affairs department . no separate account is therefore kept of the costs or expenditures involved . mr wong wai - yin : mr president , from the last paragraph of the secretary 's reply , we can clearly see that the government does not attach any importance to the implementation of this new ordinance and very little publicity has been carried out . can the secretary be more specific about the time when the publicity leaflets were printed ? how many leaflets were prepared ? how many villages were visited by liaison officers to explain this ordinance ? also , whether there is any evaluation on the effectiveness of this publicity , and if the result is not satisfactory , will more funds be made available for a wider publicity campaign ? secretary for home affairs : mr president , mr wong has just raised several questions . first , concerning the publicity leaflets , we started to print the leaflets immediately after this ordinance was enacted in 1994 . 110 000 chinese copies and 12 000 english copies were printed last time . in fact , we are going to prepare a more up - dated version in order to include new information , if any , and as a result of some amendments to the laws of inheritance . concerning the visits by liaison officers to villages , i think members are all aware that the liaison officers in the new territories have close contact with the villagers . although we do not have any stipulation on how many visits should be paid to each village by each liaison officer , at least two visits are made each week . for the time being , i believe the most direct and effective way is to explain this ordinance to them during the visits . also , the liaison officers will explain to the villagers in detail when necessary . mr wong wai - yin : the main point of my question is whether the government has assessed the effectiveness of the publicity in these two years ? secretary for home affairs : i think the effectiveness of this ordinance depends on the acceptability of the ordinance among the public and whether the ordinance has been observed . the public was certainly very concerned about this ordinance and there was a lot of feedback when it was first enacted . in fact , the villagers are still very concerned about this ordinance after all these publicity activities . they therefore do not have any difficulty in considering the succession to land . as far as we know , we have so far not received any complaints , i therefore believe our publicity is effective . mr lee wing - tat : mr president , the secretary just replied that the liaison officers at the district offices would explain this issue during their regular visits , but we have to understand that all the committee members in the villages are men . are statistics kept on the number of female villagers who have personally received publicity information on this issue and the enactment of this ordinance from the liaison officers during those visits ? secretary for home affairs : in fact , the government has been promoting one - person - one - vote elections in villages , and women should begin to assume some posts in the village committees . however , i would like to make clear one thing , liaison officers will not only visit committee members during their regular visits , but also liaise with the villagers in the villages . although we do not have the exact figures and it is difficult to calculate how many female villagers we have contacted , i believe many female villagers have received this message . president : mr lee wing - tat , are you claiming that your question has not been answered ? mr lee wing - tat : no , mr president . i will raise another supplementary question . mr albert ho : mr president , the secretary just mentioned that they could not provide many of the figures because they did not compile statistics on a particular type of lawsuits . the question i am most concerned about is that during their regular visits to villages , have officials and liaison officers at the district offices received any information or complaints concerning continued refusal to accept this ordinance by some people and continued forcible occupation of property which should be inherited by female villagers despite the enactment of this ordinance ? could such figures , if any , be provided ? secretary for home affairs : mr president , i just mentioned we did not receive any complaints in that regard . on the other hand , i have to make clear that when the liaison officers visit the villages , especially when people ask about the succession issue , they will certainly explain this ordinance to them clearly . therefore , we are in fact taking the initiative to explain this ordinance to the villagers , hoping that they can accept and comply with this ordinance in order to avoid any complaints . mr wong wai - yin : mr president , although the secretary said that both the probate registry and the court did not have the record , can the secretary still find some statistics from the legal aid department to see how many females have approached the legal aid department for assistance ? if an answer cannot be provided now , could we have a written reply ? secretary for home affairs : mr president , i think i have to say sorry to mr wong because the information kept by the legal aid department is actually the same as those kept by the court . the cases are filed by nature but not by ordinance , therefore , we cannot find the statistics from their record . mr lee wing - tat : mr president , since the ordinance has already been enacted for two years , what we are arguing about is whether those female villagers know about the existence of this ordinance . in order to confirm whether they know about this ordinance , will the home affairs department consider to conduct a simple scientific survey to ask the female villagers in those hundreds of villages , first , whether they know this ordinance has been enacted ; and second , whether they are clear about their right ? secretary for home affairs : in fact , through our contact with female villagers , we understand that many of them are aware of this matter , and we also have not received any complaints so far . therefore , i believe members should realize that they in fact have knowledge of this ordinance . in particular , members should be aware that this ordinance was raised every now and then in the past two years . however , if mr lee really thinks there is a need to conduct a survey , we will consider his proposal . written answers to questions planning criteria for hospital construction 7. mr szeto wah asked ( in chinese ) : with regard to the setting up of public hospitals and their staff establishment , will the government inform this council whether it knows of : ( a ) the standard number of hospital beds and the standard establishment of doctors and nurses , as well as the actual number of hospital beds and the strength of doctors and nurses , in each public hospital at present ; ( b ) the criteria for determining the network served by each district public hospital , as well as the criteria to be taken into account in deciding whether a public hospital should be set up in a district ; ( c ) whether there is a set of criteria for drawing up the respective proportions of population to hospital beds and population to resident doctors , if so , what the details are ; and ( d ) how " hospital clusters " are distributed and what their mode of operation is , and what the composition of each cluster is ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : mr president , the actual number of public hospital beds and the total strength of medical and nursing staff working in the hospital authority as at end of march 1996 are set out in annexes i and ii respectively . the concept of staff establishment does not apply strictly to the hospital authority which employs a staffing level mechanism based on approved posts as the basis for determining manpower requirements for individual ranks and grades . with the devolution of responsibilities , each hospital may vary their staff mix according to prevailing operational requirements . emphasis has been placed on quality outcome as well as resource input . apart from budgetary control , the authority has also developed a set of manpower indicators ( as listed in annex iii ) to assist hospital managers . as part of the efforts to improve its annual planning process , the hospital authority head office is embarking on an exercise to work out an agreed staffing level with each hospital . this process is expected to complete in the next few months and will serve to provide an objective benchmark for future monitoring and control . hospital clusters are drawn up for administrative reasons to enhance the co-ordination , planning and management of clinical services between different medical institutions . the designation of these clusters takes into account the geographic location of individual hospitals , their traditional roles and functional relationships . details about the eight existing clusters are as shown in annex iv . the hospitals in each cluster complement and support each other through cross - referral of patients , sharing of major medical equipment and other clinical support services . the objective is to maximize the use of available resources and avoid duplications or gaps in service provision . each cluster is supervised by a dedicated team of staff in the hospital authority head office . the need for new hospitals is identified through regular reviews of utilization pattern , which is affected by factors including population size , demographic structure , medical technology advancement , ambulatory care , community support and private service providers . the total demand of hospital beds is estimated based on an established formula : projected estimated inpatient average length of population x discharge rate x stay per patient 365 days x optimum occupancy rate ( 85% ) the number of doctors required in each public hospital cannot be determined solely with reference to a fixed set of criteria , but will depend on a number of factors including the role and scope of services provided , mix of cases and complexity of medical conditions . the set of manpower indicators developed by the hospital authority is an effective planning tool to assist each hospital in the planning and deployment of resources . annex i staff strength of hospital authority hospitals as at 31 march 1996 part - time staff included annex ii number of public hospital beds available by hospital by type of beds as at 31 march 1996 source : annual survey on hospital beds of ha hospital ( 1995-96 ) annex iii manpower indicators for doctors and nurses notes : 1. all figures for the doctors are in the unit of number of discharges per doctor per year unless otherwise specified 2. number of a & e first attendances per doctor per year . 3. based on number of nurses for a standard hospital ward of 34 beds with 85% occupancy ( excluding ward managers ) and a staff mix of 68% qualified nurses to 32% nurses learners . annex iv housing authority 's shop letting by negotiation 8. mr lo suk - ching ( in chinese ) : as the commercial units in housing estates under the management of the housing authority ( ha ) are mainly let by way of tenders and supplemented by negotiation , will the government inform this council if it is aware of : ( a ) the proportion of the shops in public housing estate shopping centres let by negotiation in the total number of shops let ; and how such a proportion is determined by the ha ; ( b ) the reasons for the ha not putting up all the shops for letting by open tender ; ( c ) the guidelines issued by the ha setting out clearly the criteria for letting shops by negotiation ; if so , what the criteria are ; and ( d ) any mechanism put in place by the ha to monitor the decision - making process regarding the letting of shops by negotiation ? secretary for housing ( in chinese ) : mr president , a large majority of commercial premises in housing authority ( ha ) shopping centes are let through open tender . there is no fixed ratio for the number of premises which must be let in a particular way . in the last two years , about 20% of commercial premises were let through negotiation . use of open tender or negotiation depends on the nature and size of the business to be operated . for example , in order to attract major retail companies to open outlets in public housing estates , the ha may put up a small number of commercial premises for letting through negotiation . this will enable the ha to exercise flexibility in determining the terms of each tenancy , such as length and rent . tenants selected in this way are generally popular chain - stores which are welcomed by local residents as well as other retailers in the same shopping centre because they enhance the attractiveness and increase the patronage of the centre . this method of letting commercial space is commonly adopted in the private sector . the ha 's criteria for letting commercial premises through negotiation are confined to cases where : ( a ) the space to be leased exceeds 250 sq m and the type of trade can attract more customers to the shopping centre , or can provide a desirable facility for residents ; or ( b ) the premises to be let have failed to attract suitable bidders in more than two open tender exercises ; or ( c ) an attraction is offered by the brand name of the company under which the premises are to be operated , or by the tenant 's ability to develop business through substantial promotional activities , both of which will enhance the overall attractiveness of the shopping centre ; or ( d ) where a sitting tenant has demonstrated the capability for expansion . a letting panel , chaired by the chairman of the ha 's commercial properties committee oversees the arrangements for letting commercial properties by negotiation . the leasing procedures and guidelines are also subject to periodic review by the independent commission against corruption . criteria for attorney general 's request for death inquiry 9. mr james to asked ( in chinese ) : under section 8 of the coroners ordinance , a coroner shall hold an inquiry into the cause of the death of any person when required by the attorney general . in this connection , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the total number of cases in which the coroner was required by the attorney general to hold such inquiries in the past five years ; and ( b ) the criteria on which such a request by the attorney general is based ? attorney general ( in chinese ) : mr president , section 8 of the coroners ordinance provides that a coroner shall when required by the attorney general hold an inquiry into the cause of and the circumstances connected with the death of any person . the attorney general has not exercised his power under section 8 during the past five years . there are no statutory criteria relating to the exercise of the attorney general 's power under section 8 of the coroners ordinance . in deciding whether to require that an inquiry be held in respect of the death of a particular person , an attorney general would consider whether ( a ) a coroner had refused or neglected to hold an inquiry in circumstances where he was obliged to hold one ; or ( b ) there were other circumstances that indicated that it would be in the public interest to order an inquiry . co-ordination of information on copyright ownership 10. mr james tien asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council : ( a ) what measures the government has put in place to assist industrial and commercial establishments in identifying the copyright owner of a commodity in respect of which more than one firm claim that they own the copyright of the commodity concerned , so as to prevent such establishments from purchasing commodities without copyrights ; and ( b ) of the department which is responsible for co-ordinating information about copyright owners of commodities such as songs , books , films and computer software ; and what channel is available to the commercial sector for making enquiries about such information ? secretary for trade and industry ( in chinese ) : mr president , ( a ) copyright is a private right . copyright subsists without the need for registration under the existing copyright law in hong kong . in line with international practice , the government has not established any copyright register for recording information on copyright works and the copyright owners of such works . accordingly , the government does not have information on copyright ownership or transfer . if two or more persons claim that they own the copyright on a certain commodity , the potential purchasers , be they industrial or commercial establishments , would have to ascertain the legitimacy of the claims , which are matters of evidence . it is always advisable for them to seek legal advice before making industrial or commercial decisions . ( b ) as explained , government does not have information on copyright ownership or transfer and no government department is in a position to collate such information . nevertheless , there are channels where potential purchasers of copyright works can make enquiries on the identity of the copyright owner . they are listed below : - in the music industry , the composers and authors society of hong kong limited ( cash ) issues licences for public performance , broadcasting and cable diffusion of music works . the phonographic performance ( se asia ) limited ( ppseal ) licenses sound recordings for members of the international federation of the phonographic industry ( ifpi ) . ifpi contracts with broadcasters for broadcasting its members ' sound recordings and music videos . - in the book publishing industry , some of the authors of literary dramatic or musical works and publishers for published editions of such works have joined the hong kong reprographic rights licensing society ( hkrrls ) . the society is planning to issue reprographic licences on behalf of its members . - in the film and computer software industries , some film producers and computer programmers have joined their respective associations . such associations may be able to provide some information on copyright ownership . the intellectual property department provides general information on intellectual property including copyright . it has a 24 - hour telephone enquiry hotline ( tel .:2803 5860 ) . it also has a home page on the internet ( http://www.houston.com.hk/hkgipd/ ) . polyclinic services 11. mr michael ho asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the current number of government - run polyclinics in the territory , and the number of such clinics which provide both day - time and night - time consultation services ; ( b ) whether the setting up of a polyclinic in a district is determined according to its population size ; ( c ) of the criteria for determining the need for providing both day - time and night - time consultation services in polyclinics ; and ( d ) how public hospitals and district polyclinics complement each other in providing medical services for the public ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : mr president , the term " polyclinics " is used to describe clinics which provide more than two types of medical services . at present , there are six polyclinics offering a wide range of primary health care services such as general out - patient consultation , tuberculosis and chest service , social hygiene and special skin service . the department of health is providing both day and evening consultation service . among 60 general out - patient clinics in the territory , six are located within polyclinics while 18 are providing both day and evening service . according to the hong kong planning standards and guidelines , one general out - patient clinic is normally provided for every 100 000 persons . in determining whether evening service should be provided at each clinic , due consideration will be given to relevant factors including utilization pattern of existing facilities , location and accessibility of the clinic as well as other service providers in the vicinity . a referral system is already in place so that patients requiring specialist care may be transferred from general out - patient clinics to medical institutions managed by the hospital authority for further treatment . a similar mechanism also exists whereby patients discharged from public hospitals with stable conditions can be followed up in the primary health setting . information about the medical condition and treatment of patients will be exchanged in order to ensure continuity of care . needless to say , this arrangement will be reviewed regularly in the light of changing circumstances . employees retraining scheme programmes 12. mr sin chung kai asked : regarding the retraining courses offered by the employees retraining board , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the number of workers who have joined the following programmes since the implementation of the employees retraining scheme : ( i ) general retraining programme i courses on job search skills ii . job - specific skills courses iii . general skills courses iv . skills upgrading courses ( ii ) one - the - job training programmes , with a breakdown by industry ( iii ) programmes for the elderly ( iv ) programmes for disabled and industrial accident victims ( v ) other programmes ; and ( b ) the contents of each of the above programmes ? secretary for education and manpower : mr president , ( a ) since its establishment in 1992 , the employees retraining board has provided a total of 136 149 retraining places under the retraining programmes and the on - the - job training programmes as at the end of june 1996 . a breakdown of the number of retraining places by type of course is set out below : there is no breakdown of the actual number of workers who have joined each of the above programmes and some workers might have taken more than one course since the commencement of the employees retraining scheme . ( b ) the general contents of each of the programmes are as follows : ( i ) general retraining programme i . job search skills courses �0�0 retrainees are taught job search skills , interview techniques , information on labour market , psychological coping skills , interpersonal and communication skills . ii . job - specific skills courses �0�0 retrainees are taught vocational skills for specific occupations . examples of vocational skills relate to salespersons , hotel housekeepers , receptionists , office assistants , junior account clerks , building attendants , travel assistants and domestic helpers . iii . general skills courses �0�0 retrainees are taught general vocational skills such as computer , typing and language ( for example , english , putonghua and japanese ) training . iv . skills upgrading courses �0�0 these courses are designed to help workers of a specific occupation to upgrade their skills to meet market needs . examples are skill upgrading courses for mechanical craftsmen and technicians , product design and development personnel and electroplating operatives . ( ii ) on - the - job training programme �0�0 under this programme , individual employers provide induction training which is specific to the jobs concerned after they have taken on the retrainees . ( iii ) programme for the elderly �0�0 these are specially designed courses for persons aged 50 and above . they are trained for occupations such as junior clerks , couriers , carpark attendants and domestic helpers , and in areas such as office english and basic computer skills . ( iv ) programme for disabled and industrial accident victims �0�0 this programme includes training for office assistants , cleaning services , desktop publishing , paging services , mobile kiosk work and fast food services . ( v ) other programmes �0�0 these are tailor - made courses designed to train employees for a specific firm or groups of firms , such as training for paging operators , retail salespersons , market interviewers and building attendants . control and improvement of air quality inside road tunnels 13. miss christine loh asked : in 1993 , the environmental protection department issued the " practice notes on control of air pollution in vehicle tunnels " to all tunnel operators . the notes set down guidelines on the minimum requirements for three air pollutants : carbon monoxide , nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide . as tunnel operators are already required by legislation and the terms of management contracts to monitor the concentration of carbon monoxide to ensure that it does not exceed the prescribed limits , and in view of the government 's recent statement that it will discuss with the tunnel operators the feasibility of installing nitrogen dioxide monitors inside the tunnels , will the administration inform this council whether : ( a ) it will consider bringing in regulatory control on the level of sulphur dioxide as well as other pollutants ( such as suspended particulates and various hydrocarbons ) inside road tunnels ; if so ; what the details are ; if not , why not ; and ( b ) it will adopt other measures to improve the air quality in all road tunnels to a standard conforming to the guidelines laid down in the practice notes ? secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr president , ( a ) we will consider the need for legislation to ensure the consistent application of the air quality standards set out in the practice notes to all road tunnels . the development of new legislation will , however , require time . in the meantime , and as set out in my reply to a question from the honourable choy kan - pui on 26 june 1996 , tunnel operators are already required , either by legislation or by contract terms , to monitor the level of carbon monoxide in the tunnels . they are also required to monitor visibility as well . the levels of carbon monoxide and visibility , together with nitrogen dioxide , are sufficiently indicative of the air quality inside the tunnels . ( b ) a new ventilation system with nitrogen oxides monitors has recently been installed in the lion rock tunnel and action is in hand to upgrade the air quality monitoring facilities in the airport tunnel . we are also assessing the air quality situation in the other government tunnels and upgrading work will be implemented if necessary . for franchised tunnels , the administration will continue to discuss with the tunnel operators compliance with the air quality requirements set out in the practice notes issued by the environmental protection department . a trial scheme to improve the air quality in the tate 's cairn tunnel is being conducted with the agreement and co-operation of the tunnel operator . subject to the outcome of the trial , we will work together with the tunnel operator to implement the necessary air quality improvement measures as a matter of priority . in the longer term , as noted above , we will also consider the need for legislation to ensure consistent application of the air quality standards set out in the practice notes to all tunnels . comprehensive insurance for subsidized schools 14. mr cheung man - kwong asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the coverage and the premium of the comprehensive insurance policy on public liabilities taken out by the government for all subsidized schools in the territory ; and ( b ) given the inadequate protection which students participating in extra - curricular activities or studying at schools located in the vicinity of potentially dangerous slopes can get in case of accidents , whether the government will consider increasing the insured amount and extending the coverage of the insurance policy taken out for these schools , so as to raise the amount of compensation payable to those who suffer injury or death in accidents ? secretary for education and manpower ( in chinese ) : mr president , ( a ) the block insurance policy for all aided and caput schools covering the period from 1 september 1995 to 31 august 1997 was taken out by the government at a premium of over $3.5 million . the block insurance policy includes three components : public liability insurance , employees ' compensation insurance and group personal accident insurance . the coverage of each component is set out below : public liability insurance : this covers the insured school 's legal liability for damages in respect of bodily injury to students and other persons ( other than employees of the insured school ) , and loss of or damage to property caused by an occurrence in school and / or educational activities organized by the education department or the insured school . the maximum insured sum is hk $7.5 million per occurrence and unlimited in aggregate during the period of insurance . employees ' compensation insurance : this covers bodily injury by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of employment by the insured school during the period of insurance . the maximum insured sum is hk $200 million per insured school for each and every event . group personal accident insurance : this covers accidental death and disablement benefit to each student provided that such accident occurs while the student is participating in a school activity . the maximum sum insured is hk $20,000 each student for each and every loss . ( b ) the government is considering to increase the maximum sums insured in respect of the public liability insurance and group personal accident insurance . we hope to come to a decision soon . however , we do not see the need to review the employees ' compensation insurance in respect of which the maximum sum insured is in line with the statutory requirement under the employees ' compensation ordinance ( cap . 282 ) . enforcement of seat - belt legislation 15. mrs selina chow asked ( in chinese ) : the government has introduced legislation requiring passengers in rear seats of private cars to wear seat - belts . exemption is only given to those who have been certified by competent persons and verified by the transport department ( td ) as unfit for wearing seat belts . in connection with this , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the criteria adopted by the td in verifying recommendations made by competent persons for certain individuals to be exempted from wearing seat belts ; ( b ) how the td will ensure that there is no disparity in treatment in exercising its discretionary powers ; ( c ) whether the government will consider relaxing the requirement for wearing rear seat belts , such as streamlining or even abolishing the procedure of granting exemption through the td so that certification for exemption made by competent persons can be accepted instead ; and ( d ) how the government will educate the public , particularly parents and pregnant women , on the safety measures in wearing rear seat belts ? secretary for transport ( in chinese ) : mr president , under regulation 10 of the road traffic ( safety equipment ) regulations , any person may apply to the commissioner for transport for an exemption from wearing seat belts . ( a ) in dealing with such applications , the transport department would consider the reasons put forward by the applicant , including his / her physical condition and other relevant factors such as the advice of a registered medical practitioner . the written advice from a registered medical practitioner is not a mandatory requirement but it would help facilitate processing an application . ( b ) to ensure that all cases are dealt with fairly , the transport department has drawn up guidelines for processing exemption applications . these guidelines cover the range of conditions and reasons which can be put forward by applicants for exemption , how the applications are to be substantiated , for example , by a medical practitioner , and how the applications are processed within the department . ( c ) as to arrangements for seeking exemption from wearing seat belts , the transport department will review the matter after gathering more experience in processing exemption applications before deciding whether to introduce new procedure . ( d ) since the end of 1995 , the transport department has been publicizing and educating motorists and passengers on the rear seat belt requirement through information leaflets and the road safety quarterly which are distributed through schools , district offices , transport department licensing offices , petrol stations , and so on . as from may 1996 , announcements have also been made on television and radio to publicize the matter . in addition , the road users ' code which is distributed free to all applicants of driving tests is being updated to include diagrams illustrating the proper wearing of seat belts and the use of seat belts for children and pregnant women . out - patient services 16. dr huang chen - ya asked ( in chinese ) : with regard to the out - patient services provided by the department of health and the hospital authority respectively in the past three years , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the respective numbers of patients seeking treatment and their attendance in each year ; and ( b ) the respective average cost per out - patient visit and its cost structure ( including staff salaries , costs for drugs and laboratory tests and so on ) in each year ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : mr president , the number of patient attendance in the past three years are : the average cost per patient attendance in the last three years are : the cost structure of out - patient services in the last three years are : department of health ( specialist out - patient ) hospital authority ( specialist out - patient ) government support services for matrimonial troubles 17. mr choy kan - pui asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the number of divorce cases in the territory in the past three years , and the breakdwon by year of the number of cases involving women from mainland china and other overseas countries , together with the country of origin of those women from overseas ; ( b ) of the breakdown by year of the number of people under the age of 18 affected by parental separation in the divorce cases mentioned in ( a ) above ; and ( c ) whether the relevant departments provide counselling and assistance to the affected parties in divorce cases and their family members ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : mr president , the number of divorce cases filed in the past three years is 8 626 , 9 272 and 10 292 for 1993 , 1994 and 1995 respectively . statistics giving the breakdown by the country of origin of the women involved and the number of people under the age of 18 affected by parental separation are not available . the social welfare department ( swd ) provides a wide range of services and assistance to divorcing couples and their families . marriage counselling is recommended with the objective of saving the marriage and to ease the family distress caused by crises in marital relationships . family caseworkers will also help divorcing couples understand the impact of separation or divorce on their children , and emphasize to them the need to make the family relationship work . swd 's child custody services unit also provides intensive casework service on child custody and guardianship matters arising from divorce cases . other welfare services such as financial assistance , housing assistance , child care services , psychological counselling and other family support services will also be provided to couples and their children as appropriate . referrals to the legal aid department will also be made if divorcing couples are in need of legal assistance . work permits for foreigners 18. dr law cheung - kwok asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the number of work permits which have been issued to foreigners of different nationalities , and the number of applications for such permits which have been rejected , in each of the past three years ; and ( b ) the breakdown of the foreigners who have been granted work permits by trade , type of work , age and pay , in each of the past three years ? secretary for security ( in chinese ) : mr president , ( a ) under the general policy on entry for employment , the number of employment visas issued and applications refused in the past three years , with breakdowns on the top five nationalities , ( not including those granted to contract workers and foreign domestic helpers ) are as follows : note : under the " nationality " column , some examples of " others " are thailand , south korea , india , malaysia , and indonesia . ( b ) for the employment visas issued , we do not have breakdown by trade , age , or pay . a breakdown by profession in each of the past three years is as follows : note : under the " profession " column , some examples of " others " are accountants , consultants , designers , journalists , lecturers and so on . labour importation related to second runway 19. mr leung yiu - chung asked ( in chinese ) : will the government inform this council whether : ( a ) it has estimated the job opportunities which the construction of the second runway of the new airport will create for the territory ; ( b ) the labour importation quotas set for the new airport and related projects will still apply to the second runway project ; if not , whether it will increase the labour importation quotas for the latter project ; and ( c ) in deciding if the labour importation quotas should be increased , the government will take into account both the present unemployment situation in the territory and the occurrence of incidents in which foreign workers imported under the special labour importation scheme for the new airport projects were subjected to wrongful deduction of wages ? secretary for education and manpower ( in chinese ) : mr president , the objective of the special labour importation scheme for the new airport and related projects ( slis ) is to facilitate the timely completion of the new airport and related projects by allowing contractors of such projects to import workers for job vacancies which they are genuinely unable to fill by local workers within a specified timeframe . to protect the employment opportunities of local workers , the slis is operating on the principle that local workers are given priority in filling job vacancies and that they should not be displaced by imported workers . the slis covers all projects related to the new airport . contractors who have been awarded works contracts for such projects are eligible to apply for imported workers under the scheme . my reply to the specific parts of the questions is as follows : ( a ) according to the airport authority 's assessment , the construction of the second runway and associated works on the northwest concourse of the terminal will require up to approximately 1 000 workers at the peak of the construction work . ( b ) the second runway is a new airport - related project which falls within the ambit of the slis . given the small total number of workers required for the construction of the second runway and associated works on the northwest concourse of the terminal relative to the existing quota ceiling of 17 000 under the scheme , it would not be necessary to increase the quota ceiling for this purpose . ( c ) we have no plans to increase the quota ceiling under the slis despite the possible need for imported workers arising from the second runway project . if the contractors of the second runway and associated works on the northwest concourse of the terminal wish to apply for imported workers under the slis , they have to comply fully with all the existing rules and procedures of the scheme . senior citizen card scheme 20. mr fred li asked ( in chinese ) : with regard to the operation of the senior citizen card scheme ( the scheme ) , will the government inform this council : ( a ) whether it will conduct a comprehensive review of the scheme since the scheme has been implemented for two years ; ( b ) of the regular publicity campaigns by the social welfare department to promote the scheme ; ( c ) how business organizations are invited to participate in the scheme ; ( d ) whether consideration will be given to the automatic issue of senior citizen cards to the elderly through the immigration department ; ( e ) whether there is any mechanism to monitor those business establishments which have pledged to offer concessionary services to the elderly in order to ascertain if such establishments have honoured their pledges ; and whether there is any channel for the elderly to lodge complaints against those organizations which fail to provide concessionary services in accordance with their pledges ; and ( f ) whether the home affairs department has made use of its regional network ( such as the regional consultative organizations throughout the territory ) to promote the scheme ; if so , what promotional activities have been organized ; if not , why not ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : mr president , ( a ) by the end of june 1996 , 427 699 applications from elderly people , representing about 70% of the elderly population , had been received by the social welfare department senior citizen card office . 423 320 cards have been issued and the remaining applications are being processed . so far , 424 companies and organizations with a total of 2 133 outlets have joined the scheme to offer concessions and / or priority services to senior citizens . regular reviews and monitoring of the scheme are carried out by social welfare department . as the scheme has operated smoothly so far , a comprehensive review is not considered to be necessary . ( b ) application forms and promotional posters are available to the public at service counters of various government departments and non-governmental organizations . promotional programmes , exhibitions and publications are also provided at district level and the senior citizen card ambassador programmes further assist in promoting the scheme . ( c ) business organizations are invited to participate in the scheme by invitation letters , telephone contacts and so on . in addition , senior citizen card ambassador programmes have recently been organized on a trial basis at district level . through these programmes , elderly people as well as volunteers act as ambassadors and personally invite business organizations at district level to join the scheme to offer concessions and priority services to the elderly . so far , more than 50 organizations have been recruited under these programmes . in view of its achievements , this promotional strategy will continue to be used . ( d ) the right to disclose the personal data of individuals is limited by the need to protect that person 's privacy . the immigration department holds information on individuals ' age as a result of the registration of persons but this is done for purposes which do not include the issue of senior citizen cards . the registration of persons ordinance and its subsidiary regulations prohibit the disclosure of a registered person 's particulars . the release of personal data kept by the immigration department for the purpose of issuing senior citizen cards could be regarded as an arbitrary interference with privacy and would thus breach article 14 of the bill of rights . moreover , such disclosure of information would also breach the provisions of legislation on data protection which is soon to come into effect . given these considerations , it would not be appropriate to use such information without the consent of the individual concerned . it is far preferable for elderly people to be given the free choice whether or not to apply for a senior citizen card on the understanding that the personal data they supply when applying will be used solely for the issue of the card . ( e ) participation of business organizations in the senior citizen card scheme is entirely voluntary as the objectives of the scheme are to raise community respect and concern for elderly people . if elderly people find that certain companies do not honour their pledges , they can make direct complaints to the companies concerned . the social welfare department is also prepared to relay such complaints to the companies concerned and to seek clarification as and when necessary . ( f ) since the introduction of the scheme in 1994 , the home affairs department has been actively assisting the social welfare department in the promotion of the scheme through its close relationship with district boards and extensive local liaison network . publicity efforts have been and will continue to be made on the following fronts : ( i ) application forms and publicity materials for the scheme are distributed at the public enquiry service centres run by the home affairs department in all 18 of their districts ; ( ii ) to help make the scheme more widely known at the district level , these forms and materials are also sent to area committees , rural committees , mutual aid committees , owners corporations and other district organizations . district office staff have also helped promote the scheme during their day - to - day contacts with local residents ; and ( iii ) the home affairs department has been assisting the social welfare department in appealing to district boards for support . the opportunity has been taken to promote awareness of the scheme in many community building programmes organized by district offices , district boards or local organizations for the elderly . the public in general and elderly people in particular are well aware of the scheme . the home affairs department will continue to help the social welfare department in attracting even higher patronage and more sponsorship for the scheme . bills first reading of bills commissioner for administrative complaints ( amendment ) bill 1996 employment ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1996 employees ' compensation ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1996 independent police complaints council bill patents bill bills read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to standing order 41 (3) . second reading of bills commissioner for administrative complaints ( amendment ) bill 1996 the chief secretary to move the second reading of : " a bill to amend the commissioner for administrative complaints ordinance . " he said : mr president , i move that the commissioner for administrative complaints ( amendment ) bill 1996 be read a second time . this bill has three purposes . the first purpose is to empower the commissioner for administrative complaints ( comac ) to investigate those administrative actions taken by or on behalf of the police , the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) , and the secretariats of the independent police complaints council and the public service commission in relation to the code on access to information . the second purpose is to enhance the operation of comac , and the third is to change comac 's english title to " the ombudsman " . code on access to information we have stated publicly that we will extend the code on access to information throughout the government by the end of this year . under his existing statutory powers , the comac may investigate whether a branch or department listed in schedule 1 to the ordinance has failed to apply the code properly . however , schedule 1 does not include the police , the icac , or the two secretariats of the independent police complaints council and the public service commission , which are thus outside the comac 's jurisdiction . while we do not propose that the comac be given general jurisdiction to investigate complaints of maladministration on the part of these four departments , we consider that it would be more efficient for the operation of the code , and less confusing to members of the public , to have a single independent review body under the code . we therefore propose that the comac ordinance be amended so that the comac may investigate complaints of non-compliance with the code against these four agencies , for example , the police , the icac , and the two secretariats of the independent police complaints council and the public service commission . amendment to schedule 2 when the police and the icac are brought within the comac 's jurisdiction for the purpose of the code , we need to ensure the security of sensitive materials relating to the prevention , detection or investigation of crime . we therefore propose to amend schedule 2 to the ordinance to make it clear that the comac is not to investigate any action taken in relation to the prevention , detection or investigation of any crime or offence . secrecy provision section 15 of the comac ordinance requires the comac and his staff to maintain secrecy in respect of all matters that come to their knowledge in the exercise of their functions . this is unnecessarily wide . the bill seeks to make it clear that the provision only covers matters arising from any investigation a complaint made to the comac or his staff in the exercise of their complaint - handling functions , and that the comac and his staff may disclose information that is necessary to be disclosed for the purpose of investigating a complaint , or deciding on whether an investigation should be undertaken , continued or discontinued . reporting requirement the comac also finds that the present reporting requirement in the ordinance poses problems for the efficient discharge of his functions in view of the large increase in the number of complaints made to his office . this is particularly so in respect of simple complaints where the organization being complained against agrees with his findings and recommendations . the comac wished to have greater flexibility in handling simple and minor complaints . we therefore propose that the reporting requirements set out in section 16 (1) of the ordinance , for example , when the comac has formed a view that there is maladministration or inadequacy on the part of the organization being investigated , should be made discretionary instead of mandatory . however , section 17 (2) of the ordinance would still require the comac to inform the organization affected of the outcome of his investigations . change in title the comac considers that his powers and jurisdiction are more akin to those of a traditional ombudsman following the legislative changes effected in june 1994 . he has proposed that his english title be changed to " the ombudsman " as this would facilitate his contacts with his overseas counterparts . this proposal is now implemented in the bill . i commend the bill to honourable members . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . employment ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1996 the secretary for education and manpower to move the second reading of : " a bill to amend the employment ordinance . " secretary for education and manpower : mr president , i move that the employment ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1996 be read a second time . the bill proposes to increase the daily rate of sickness allowance from the existing two thirds to four fifths of an employee 's daily wage during his sick leave , while the other requirements remain unchanged , that is , an employee is only eligible for sickness allowance when he takes sick leave for not less than four consecutive days , and the need to take the sick leave has to be certified by a medical practitioner or a registered dentist . when the sickness allowance provision under the employment ordinance was first enacted in 1973 , sickness allowance was half of the employee 's wage . after the government made an amendment in 1977 , the sickness allowance was increased to two thirds of the employee 's daily wage , and has remained at that level since . the government has recently conducted a review on the rate of sickness allowance , and also taken into account the international labour conventions no . 130 medical care and sickness benefits convention 1969 , the provisions concerning sickness benefits in neighbouring countries and the findings of a survey on sickness incidence of employees . having completed the review , the government decides to increase the daily rate of sickness allowance from two thirds to four fifths of an employee 's wage , while maintaining the existing requirement that an employee is eligible for allowance only if he takes sick leave for not less than four consecutive days . the employment ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1996 seeks to put this proposal into practice . the proposals in this bill have already been endorsed by the labour advisory board earlier . we have also promised the labour advisory board that we will review other provisions relating to sickness allowance after the enactment of this bill . mr president , i beg to move . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . employees ' compensation ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1996 the secretary for education and manpower to move the second reading of : " a bill to amend the employees ' compensation ordinance . " secretary for education and manpower : mr president , i move the second reading of the employees ' compensation ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1996 . the bill seeks to enhance the compensation awarded to employees on sick leave due to injury at work . according to the current employees ' compensation ordinance , an employee who is incapacitated continuously for over three days due to injury substained at work will be eligible for scheduled compensation calculated at two thirds of the difference between his monthly income before and after the accident . medical expenses are additional to the above . the administration has closely scrutinized the provisions on scheduled payments with reference to the workmen 's compensation ( accident ) convention ( no . 17 ) and the employment injury benefits convention ( no . 121 ) of the international labour conventions , regulations governing compensation for employment injury in neighbouring countries as well as opinions from employers and employees . the objective of the present employees ' compensation ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill are as follow : ( a ) to remove the current three - day requirement before scheduled payments and medical compensation can be made so that an employee who is temporarily incapacitated will be eligible for the two compensation payments irrespective of the period of incapacity ; and ( b ) to amend the method of calculating scheduled payments , increasing the payments from two thirds to four fifths of the income difference before and after the injury . based on the above suggestions , the administration has also reviewed the compensation mechanism and arbitration procedure in respect of compensation claims under the employees ' compensation ordinance . according to current rules , if an employee is incapacitated continuously for more than three days , the employer must in 14 days after the accident inform the commissioner for labour in a prescribed form according to the employees ' compensation regulations irrespective of compensation liability . the employer must supply , in the prescribed form , information about the employer and the employee , details of the accident , details of compensation insurance taken out for the employee , the employee 's income , details and amount of the compensation agreed by the employer and the employee , the nature and the cause of the injury sustained by the employee . the administration now suggests that an employee who has sustained an injury at work should be entitled to compensation for temporary incapacity irrespective of the period of incapacity . this will lead to an increase in the number of claims for scheduled payments . meanwhile , an employee who is incapacitated for less than three days usually suffers a less serious injury and their claims will be simpler than cases in which the period of incapacity is longer . so we propose to simplify the declaration procedure . specifically , we propose that if an employee is incapacitated due to injury at work for less than three days , the employer can make a relatively simple declaration to the commissioner for labour , who will then by administrative means direct the employer to use a new form in order to simplify the declaration procedure and reduce the administrative burden of both the employer and the labour department . at present , if an employee who has sustained an injury wishes to claim scheduled payments from the employer , he has to apply to the district court . according to our practical experience , the amounts claimed for temporary incapacity for less than three days are not big . so we suggest that these claims can be regarded as civil claims and be heard by the small claims tribunal and not solely heard by the district court . as it is expected that the number of claims will increase after the amendments made by the employees ' compensation ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1996 , this arrangement will cut down the work load of the district court and shorten the waiting time for trial of these cases . after such an arrangement has been put in place , the procedure for these claims will be brought in line with those for medical expenses claims . mr president , i beg to move question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . independent police complaints council bill the secretary for security to move the second reading of : " a bill to provide a statutory basis for the independent police complaints council , to define its functions and powers , and to provide for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith . " she said : mr president , i move the second reading of the independent police complaints council ( ipcc ) bill . the bill seeks to give statutory status to the ipcc and enhance its monitoring role as a civilian oversight body on complaints against the police . the bill will provide the legal basis for the ipcc to discharge its functions of monitoring and reviewing investigations by the complaints against police office ( capo ) , which deals with all complaints against police officers . where the ipcc identifies any inadequacies or discrepancies in police investigations , they will be taken up with the capo . if not satisfied with the capo 's investigation , the ipcc can draw a case to the attention of the governor . specifically , the bill would empower the ipcc to require the capo to investigate or reinvestigate any complaint . the bill also provides that the ipcc may interview witnesses , complainants or complainees . this will enable the ipcc to clarify ambiguities and discrepancies and make a better assessment of the whole complaint case . further , ipcc members can also conduct scheduled or surprise visits to observe investigations by the capo directly . in carrying out their duties , ipcc members enjoy the same protection and privileges as are given to magistrates . mr president , the bill will firmly anchor the ipcc in our police complaints system by defining clearly in the legislation the powers and functions of the ipcc . in turn , this will promote the accountability of the ipcc . according to the bill , the ipcc shall in each year make a report to the governor concerning the exercise of its functions and the governor shall lay the report before this council . in recent years , we had already implemented a number of measures to improve our police complaints system , such as the installation of closed circuit television , video or tape - recording facilitates in the capo . we are , however , not complacent with the improvements made so far . in parallel with the bill , we will therefore introduce a new package of improvement measures aimed at further enhancing the independence of the ipcc , and the credibility and transparency of the police complaints system . these improvement measures are drawn up from the recommendations arising from an independent review of capo procedures conducted under the ipcc aegis , and a comparative study of overseas police complaints systems conducted by representatives from the ipcc , security branch and the police . the full reports have been made available to members of this council . the improvement measures are summarized as follows : ( i ) to address the concern that some complaints may have taken considerable time to complete , the capo will set time limits on handling complaints . these include contacting a complainant within two working days , providing progress report to the complainant every two months , aiming to complete investigation of complaint cases within four months �0�0 it will be shorter in practice if the case is less complicated ; ( ii ) to enhance transparency of the system , the ipcc will open part of its meetings to the public ; complainants will be given more details of the investigation results ; and leaflets on police complaints investigation procedures and the monitoring procedures of the ipcc will be made available at all police stations and district offices for distribution . on top of these , we intend to allocate three million dollars to the ipcc secretariat to launch publicity programmes over a three - year period ; ( iii ) to ensure serious cases will receive adequate attention in the complaints system , the ipcc will set up a special panel to monitor serious cases , after which it will submit its findings in a special report to the governor ; ( iv ) to enhance the capability of the ipcc , one additional vice-chairman and three additional members will be appointed . besides , one more vetting team will be provided ; ( v ) to prevent any " tipping - off " to officers being complained , capo procedures will be tightened up to make this a disciplinary offence ; and ( vi ) to gauge public opinion towards the overall performance of the force including the police complaints system , regular surveys and researches will be conducted . mr president , i believe that by enacting the bill and implementing the above package of improvement measures , we would make the system more transparent and credible . it will enhance the public awareness of and confidence in the existing police complaints system . thank you , mr president . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . patents bill the secretary for trade and industry to move the second reading of : " a bill to make new provision in respect of patents and related matters in substitution for the registration of patents ordinance . " she said : mr president , i move that the patents bill be read the second time . the purpose of the bill is to establish an independent patent registration system in hong kong , which is in line with international standards and will continue through 1997 , for the protection of inventions . a patent protects technical innovation . a patent system encourages new technology by granting the inventor a patent for his invention which gives him the right to exploit his invention for a set term . an inventor in exchange is required to make his invention public . the disclosure of this invention provides a major source of technical information to other inventors , businessmen and other users . at present , there is no original grant of patents in hong kong . we register in hong kong united kingdom patents and european patents designating the united kingdom . a local patent law needs to be enacted before 1 july 1997 because the existing patent registration law is dependent on united kingdom patent law . the patents bill aims to achieve this . the bill largely follows the recommendations made by the patents steering committee in its report issued for consultation in may 1993 , and incorporates , where appropriate , comments received from the industrial , professional and academic fields during a consultation exercise conducted in february and march this year . the patents bill provides for the grant of independent patents in hong kong based on the registration of a patent granted by designated patent offices . we propose the united kingdom patent office , the european patent office designating the united kingdom , and the chinese patent office as designated patent offices . it also provides for the grant of short - term patents . this will give a new type of protection in hong kong for inventions with a short - term commercial life . the bill sets out the procedures for obtaining and maintaining patents and short - term patents in hong kong , the rights given to the owners , and provisions for enforcement . the basis for the bill and the new independent patent system have been agreed in the sino - british joint liaison group . mr president , a new local patent law is an essential tool for protection of technical innovation . it is also an integral part of hong kong 's intellectual property regime . to ensure continuity in the protection of inventions in hong kong , the new local patent law and the necessary administrative system must be put in operation before i july 1997 . at the risk of stating the obvious , i would just like to note that any delay in the implementation of the new patent system would jeopardize the protection of patents in hong kong after 1997 , with all its consequential negative implications for the further economic and technological development of hong kong . by introducing the patents bill into this council today , we hope that honourable members will give the earliest possible consideration to the bill . we hope that the bill can be enacted with enough time remaining for us to prepare the necessary patents rules and administrative procedures for the implementation of the new patent system before 1 july 1997 . by introducing the patents bills into this council today and having regard to the 12 - month lead time required for procuring and setting up the first phase of the computer system , we also hope that honurable members will vote the necessary funds sought for the patent computer system at a forthcoming meeting of the finance committee of this council before it goes into summer recess . the time - table we have set for ourselves is an extremely tight one . with support from honourable members , i am confident we can achieve our task . mr president , i commend this bill to the council . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . resumption of second reading debate on bills prevention of bribery ( miscellaneous provisions ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1995 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 18 october 1995 mr james to : mr president , the purpose of the prevention of bribery ( miscellaneous provisions ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1995 is to implement the recommendations of , and matters arising from , the report of the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) review committee 1994 . the no .1 bill of this ordinance was tabled in this council in may 1995 during the last session , and this council immediately formed a bills committee to study it . the bills committee held four meetings in june 1995 , three of which with the administration . because of the complexity of the bill , the bills committee then was unable to complete the work in that session . the administration therefore tabled the no . 2 bill , which is exactly the same bill , to this council in october . to study this bill , this council formed a bills committee in november last year . the bills committee has held 18 meetings with the government . also , together with the administration , the bills committee has held separate meetings with representatives of the finance branch and inland revenue department ( ird ) , the police / icac operational liaison group as well as representatives of the hong kong journalists association . the bills committee has altogether held 22 meetings and received written submissions from 27 organizations . as chairman of this bills committee , i have mixed feelings myself . the bill is involved with very complicated issues but i am very pleased that the bills committee and the administration were ultimately able to exchange views in an open and liberal manner so that both sides were able to reach an agreement on most issues with the exception of the amendment to section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance ( pobo ) . on behalf of the bills committee , i would like to express our gratitude to representatives of the administration , especially to the then deputy solicitor general ( legal policy ) , mr robert allcock , for their open - mindedness in the discussions and their constructive ideas during the committee 's in - depth examination of the bill . i have to express my thanks to the staff of the legislative council secretariat as well . first of all , i want to highlight the several major issues discussed by the bills committee and then i will speak on my personal opinions on the bill . a . clause 4 to amend section 13 (1) of the pobo ( special powers of investigation ) i have raised the point in the bills committee that the special powers of the commissioner of the icac ( the commissioner ) under section 13 (1) of the pobo should be subject to court control , in line with the proposed amendments to the power to obtain information under section 14 of the pobo and to the power to search under section 17 of the pobo . the administration pointed out that unlimited court intervention would interfere with the efficiency of the icac and the confidentiality of its investigation . nevertheless , they finally agreed that a distinction should be made between requirements imposed under the section directed at suspects and those directed at third parties ( banks , for example ) , and also to introduce the requirement of " reasonable cause to believe " that documents to be produced were " likely to be relevant " for the purposes of an investigation . hence , they will move committee stage amendments to the section . having considered another recommendation made by me , the administration agreed to delete references to safe - deposit boxes in the section and will move committee stage amendments to it . the bills committee recommends that members support the amendments . b . clause 5 to add new sections 13a ( order to make material available and to render assistance ) and 13b ( disclosure of information obtained under section 13a ) the honourable eric li was concerned that should parties other than the ird be able to access tax records , it would undermine the confidentiality of the tax records and infringe the rights of the taxpayers . the bills committee shared his concern . the administration explained that it was necessary to establish a person 's assets in order to prove that he had committed a corruption offence . they considered that the requirement of the approval of the high court would prevent the icac 's unnecessary invocation of this provision . however , the administration agreed to move committee stage amendments to spell out in legislation that an investigating officer of the icac would need to have the approval of the commissioner or the deputy commissioner of the icac in order to make an application for tax records . the icac would also draw up internal guidelines concerning such application . the attorney general will undertake later on that information obtained under this provision shall not be disclosed to other parties . the bills committee then pointed out that there should be statutory guidelines to circumscribe the situations under which orders were made to enable tax records to be produced to the icac and that measures should be made to prevent innocent taxpayers ' records being made public as evidence . the administration responded by agreeing to introduce statutory guidelines to the " public interest " test in a new section 13a and to add a new section 13c to restrict the publication of information disclosed . the bills committee recommends that members support the proposed provisions as amended by the administration 's committee stage amendments . c . clause 6 to amend section 14 of the pobo ( power to obtain information ) the present legislation has no provision for challenge against an order made by a high court judge in an ex parte application . the bills committee questioned whether the absence of such power might be inconsistent with the hong kong bill of rights ordinance . upon consideration , the administration confirmed that this would not be the case . however , they agreed to move committee stage amendments to clause 6 ( a ) to specify that the ex parte application was to be made to the high court in chambers and to restrict the issue of notices to third parties . the administration will move the relevant committee stage amendments later on . d . clause 15 to amend section 8 (2) of the independent commission against corruption ordinance ( icaco ) ( appointment of officers ) the new section 8 (2) has set out in writing the existing dismissal procedure and the right of an officer to appeal . having been asked by the bills committee , the administration agreed to move committee stage amendments to the provision of the bill requiring the commissioner , as a statutory procedure , to consult the advisory committee on corruption before dismissing an officer . the administration will move a relevant amendment at the committee stage . the bills committee also considered whether there was a need to set up an independent appeal mechanism in respect of the dismissal of an icac officer . in view of the fact that this would have a far - reaching effect on the constitutional and legal systems as well as the allocation of resources , the committee decided not to pursue this matter at this stage . e . clause 17 to amend section 13 of the icaco ( power of the commissioner ) in response to a question raised by the bills committee , the administration agreed to move an amendment to restrict an icac officer 's access to records , books and other documents of a public body which he reasonably considered would reveal the practices and procedures of that public body . although i still have reservation about whether the icac should be given the mandatory power to obtain information to enable it to give advice on corruption , i think that the proposed amendment can meet my concern . the bills committee shared my views and therefore recommends that members support the amendment . f . section 30 of the pobo ( offence to disclose identity and so on of persons being investigated ) to achieve a right balance between freedom of the press and anti-corruption work , the honourable miss christine loh pointed out that there is a need to amend this section and the honourable albert ho shared her view . the bills committee therefore had an in - depth study on the section and the various amendments proposed . during the process of deliberation , it studied the legislation of some other jurisdictions which was similar to this section , met representatives of the hong kong journalists association and had the benefit of the privy council 's judgement in the ming pao case which was delivered on 20 may 1996 . the privy council judgement held that section 30 should apply only to an investigation in respect of a specified person . disclosure of the details of a general investigation , as occurred in the ming pao case , was not an offence . protection of the reputation of the suspect was of secondary importance to the protection of the integrity of the investigation . the bills committee referred to some historic information in order to study the legislative intent of this section . the committee concluded that the section should apply only to an investigation in respect of a specified person . the icac was very concerned about the judgement of the privy council and considered that a general investigation should also remain covered as it was equally vulnerable to being prejudiced by a disclosure as one in respect of an identified suspect . the icac would therefore like to amend section 30 so that it would also apply to general investigations . the bills committee had doubts over this . however , the administration will move committee stage amendments to this section . on the other hand , the bills committee studied several proposed amendments to the section . despite their efforts , the bills committee and the administration were still unable to come up with a proposal acceptable to both sides . however , during the discussion , we found that we had reason to add to the definition of " reasonable excuse " for disclosure of information some recognized elements of defence in the public interest such as the illegal acts and improper behaviour of icac officers , and serious threats to public order . mr president , although the bills committee is unable to put forward recommendations acceptable to all , the honourable mrs selina chow , miss christine loh , mr albert ho and the administration will express their views on and move committee stage amendments to this section . after i have spoken , they will speak in turn . g . section 10 of the icaco ( power of arrest ) the bills committee was concerned that the icac could use its special powers to investigate corruption offences for investigation of non-corruption offences . in this connection , the administration and representatives of the police / icac operational liaison group who attended the bills committee meeting assured the bills committee that the parties concerned had already taken adequate measures to prevent unnecessary employment of those powers . the bills committee decided to refer the operational aspect of the issue to the legislative council panel on security for review . mr president , i have just summarized the points raised in the bills committee which were of greater importance . during the deliberation process , members of the bills committee have put forward many other ideas and we have discussed them many times . because of the limited time , i cannot go over them one by one in detail here . all these views and the whole deliberation process have been recorded in the relevant papers submitted by the bills committee which i believe members have carefully read already . therefore , in the remaining time , i will speak on my own views on the spirit of this bill . the following are some of my own views . in fact , we are all very clear about the background of this review and reform . as the icac has been established for 20 years , we have the need to conduct a review . moreover , with the incident of alex tsui as the background and the return of sovereignty in 1997 , different commercial and social cultures will make the people and foreign investors worry about an increase in corruption as well as whether the icac will be able to cope with the situation after 1997 . the survey conducted by the icac last year revealed that over 70% of the people were worried that the situation in respect of corruption after 1997 would worsen , 50% of the people considered that corruption was still widely in existence and only 35% thought it was not common . also , 60% of the people thought that the authorities should step up their monitoring on the icac while 30% thought that it should remain unchanged . i think the most important aim of this review is to lay down sound legislation to enable the icac to have adequate and effective powers to carry out its work efficiently ; but on the other hand , it is also very important to establish an effective monitoring framework to prevent the abuse of power and that is also a great concern of the people as shown in a recent survey . recently , people in the commercial sector have also expressed their worry that the icac , ird , the securities and futures commission and the commercial crime bureau in the future could become tools for the chief executive to abuse his powers and to come down on his political or economic opponents under extreme circumstances . under the present circumstances , as the icac reports directly to the governor , the only body which really or indirectly represents the people in the monitoring of the icac is the operations review committee of the icac . however , the government has simply not appointed any legislative council members to serve on this committee , not even one ! it really amazes me as this is an important recommendation in the report of the review committee . i feel that if the government does not even trust the legislative council members , or in other words , there is not even one member appointed by the government to this committee , people may not have adequate confidence in its credibility . we think that we not only have to enforce the law , what is more important and more fundamental is to consolidate an honest , clean and anti-corruption culture . in the recent survey , we have found that some young people do not have enough alertness to the harm of corruption . that may be because they , including myself , have no personal experience of the harm and pains resulted from corruption . therefore , the emphasis of our future work will be more on this aspect . the fight against corruption is not only the responsibility of the icac but it concerns the whole community . it cannot be considered successful until the whole community can no longer tolerate corruption and people make it their own responsibility to combat it . on the other hand , i believe that icac has to strengthen its co-operation with the chinese side in the fight against cross - border corruption cases . one thing worth noting is that there have been reports recently that icac officers " had gone too far " in their undercover operations in one or two cases which were criticized by the judges as luring others into breaking the law . what we need are smart , courageous and prudent investigators . i hope that they and their superiors can set a bottom line within the law and they would exercise self-restraint . hence , the icac should review the relevant monitoring procedure . finally , with these amendments , i think we can basically strike a balance between human rights and the powers needed by the icac . i expect the icac to fulfil its mission and not to let people down . i also urge the people throughout the territory to support the work of the icac and to consolidate hong kong 's honest and clean culture in the run up to the 21st century . looking ahead , we see that hong kong has a greater need for the slogan " hatred of corruption , the advantage of hong kong people " rather than the slogan " icac , the advantage of hong kong " . without doubt , the slogan of " icac , the advantage of hong kong " is very meaningful but i consider it more important for the hong kong people to find their advantage in their hatred of corruption . miss christine loh : mr president , today 's debate concludes more than a year of scrutiny by this council of the prevention of bribery ( miscellaneous provisions ) ( no . 2 ) bill . in the view of some critics , the council should long ago have stopped dawdling and enacted the bill put before it . i strongly disagree with this view . on the contrary , i believe that what has been achieved by this council 's attention to the bill demonstrates very clearly how valuable its legislative work is to the community . i make this observation not only from the standpoint of a member of the legislative council bills committee that studied the bill , but also as a member of the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) review committee . it was the review committee 's recommendations a year and a half ago that formed the basis for this bill in the first place . it has been an instructive experience to sit on both these committees , one of them an advisory body that held its deliberations in private , the other a legislative one working in the open . the many suggestions for reform made by the review committee in its public report provided a solid foundation for this legislation . but as a participant , i was struck by that committee 's unwillingness to come to grips with some issues . there was no doubt , for example , that section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance raised fundamental questions : questions about the need for secrecy to protect investigations ; about when criminal liability should arise from innocent acts ; about the public 's right to know about icac activity ; and about the danger to innocent reputations posed by icac investigations . section 30 has always generated public controversy , and recently gave rise to litigation that reached the privy council . nevertheless , i found it impossible even to initiate a discussion of section 30 in the review committee . the committee readily accepted the icac 's initial representations on section 30 . it was simply not interested in entering this particular controversy . it is often said , and indeed it was the justification of the review committee 's own closed meetings , that an advisory body is able to provide more candid and useful advice on controversial issues if it meets in private . my experience was the opposite : closed meetings enabled the committee virtually to ignore an issue that was clearly of importance to the public . by contrast , the legislative council bills committee did not hesitate to press the administration in public on matters the review committee had explored briefly or not at all in private . although the icac and the administration resisted such pressure , after persistent discussion in the bills committee , the administration accepted that there was indeed a need for change in several , important areas . mr president , the bills committee 's results speak clearly for the value of the open legislative process . the attorney general will move several major amendments developed in the bills committee . one set of amendments will significantly enhance protection for taxpayers affected by the icac 's new power to examine tax records . despite strong icac resistance , other amendments will for the first time give the courts a role in authorizing the inspection of account information , one of icac 's most frequently used powers . and , very reluctantly , the administration has acceded to some relaxation of section 30 's draconian restrictions on publicity about investigations . it should come as no surprise that the open legislative process practised by this council produces results . it does a disservice to the community to take a narrow view of this council 's legislative role . i believe the administration has only gone half way towards a sensible revision of section 30 , and i will later propose one of several private member 's amendments to that section . aside from section 30 , i support this bill and all the amendments proposed to it . miss margaret ng : mr president , let me state from the outset that i do not think this bill goes far enough in removing some of the most draconian powers of the icac , particularly in relation to section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance . therefore , i will support the second reading of the bill on the basis of the amendments to be introduced by the honourable albert ho and miss christine loh at the committee stage . in this community , we all recognize the importance of fighting corruption . we all recognize the importance of giving the necessary powers to the icac to fight corruption . however , this does not mean that , in the name of fighting corruption , the icac can claim unlimited power and privilege , or place itself above other law enforcement agents , above the rights of the individual and above the law . it is in this spirit that a review committee was set up in 1994 to review the relevant law , and in this spirit that the present bill was proposed . and that is why i am totally astonished by the administration 's attempt to amend section 30 in a way which enlarges the power of the icac and further restricts the rights of the individual . mr president , such a move is not to be countenanced . section 30 has nothing to do with the icac 's power of investigation . it aims at restricting anyone from reporting on it by making disclosure a criminal offence . as such , it restricts the freedom of speech , the freedom of the press , the freedom of information , and the public 's right to be informed . while no freedom is absolute , every restriction has to be clearly and fully justified . in looking at section 30 , we must never lose sight of that . it is not a question of what powers it may be convenient for the icac to have , but whether certain restrictions , and further restrictions on the citizen 's rights can be allowed . as the judicial committee of the privy council has made clear in a recent decision concerning the ming pao daily news , section 30 restricts the disclosure of an icac investigation only when there is an identified suspect . the administration 's amendment seeks to criminalize disclosure regardless of whether a suspect has been identified . this plainly broadens the scope of the infringement of rights and freedoms , contrary to the entire spirit of the bill . mr president , the attorney general puts it mildly as " plug [ ging ] a loophole disclosed by the recent privy council decision " , but the icac commissioner leaves us in no doubt as to what the icac 's true attitude is , and always has been . in a letter to members of this council , he reiterates a view he had earlier expressed in a newspaper article . in his view , the present amendment " restores " section 30 to the meaning the icac had always given it . otherwise dire consequences will follow . it will , he says , seriously impair the icac 's capability to investigate corruption . the attitude is quite clear , mr president . in the commissioner 's view , the law is what the icac considers it to be , and if the court does not agree , then the law must be changed to support the icac 's view . can we really endorse this kind of attitude ? can we entrust the icac with greater powers than it strictly needs , in the confidence that they will not be abused ? that the icac will not gag the press except in a case where the investigation is such as to make it necessary ? i am sure that it is this fear of abuse which prompted the honurable albert ho to introduce his amendment , stipulating that a disclosure is a criminal offence only if it is " likely to prejudice the investigation " . where there is no likelihood of prejudicing the investigation , the press should not be gagged . the administration argues that such a requirement would be too difficult to meet , and would render section 30 nearly meaningless . mr president , is not a strict requirement only reasonable , where fundamental rights are put at risk ? indeed , we are not talking about a theoretical or speculative fear of abuse . we are not talking in the realms of ideals but stark reality and an actual event . that event is well - known . we have the ming pao case before us . as members know , ming pao and three of its editors were charged under section 30 for a news report on 3 august 1994 . the subject of the icac investigation was a land auction on 26 may 1994 in which several developers joined hands in a bid to keep the prices down . the auction was open . the behaviour of those developers were openly seen . the whole thing was given prominent coverage in all the major newspapers . the incident was widely discussed and commented upon . the icac did not think it a matter for investigation until , sometime afterwards , it received a letter suggesting that they should carry out an investigation . the letter , which was read out at the trial in court , contained no other information or allegation to any specific individual . the ming pao report disclosing the investigation hardly went beyond the fact that the icac was investigating it , and approaching media organizations to gather information . given the above facts , how can the report have prejudiced any investigation ? was there any real fear that suspects would be alerted to take flight , or evidence be destroyed ? was anyone 's reputation unjustifiably at stake ? were , indeed , icac officers going about it in a secretive way ? how was that investigation different from other police investigations such that it requires different treatment ? and yet , while no more is heard of the investigation , ming pao daily news was charged under section 30 . not just the organization �0�0 in order perhaps to " teach the media a lesson " �0�0 but three editors were also charged as co-defendants . but for the fact that ming pao took a strong stand and had the resources to go all the way to the privy council , but for the fact that section 30 does not apply where no suspect had been identified , these three individuals would almost certainly have been convicted . anyone would have been entitled to call them criminals with the stigma of an offence under an anti-bribery legislation . under the law , they would also have been deprived of important political rights for 10 years . why such oppressive measures ? is it in the public interest ? or is it to assuage the wounded pride of the icac ? is the fear of abuse theoretical , or is it real and present ? mr president , forgive me if i use passionate language . but the power of prosecution is a dreadful weapon in the hands of the executive . it could be used oppressively against the innocent without redress . where an attempt is being made to enlarge that power , indeed , to legitimize what , in my opinion , amounts to an abuse of that power , i cannot be other than passionately in opposition . section 30 ought to be scrapped . the honourable albert ho 's amendment is the least that we can accept . thank you , mr president . mr albert ho : mr president , in the past 20 - odd years , the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) has been engaging in the work of combatting corruption . with the extensive support of the public in hong kong , the achievements of the icac have been recognized both locally and overseas . we are in support of the work of the icac in making hong kong an honest society and creating a fair and just investment environment so that local and overseas investors can have sufficient protection when engaging in investment activities in hong kong . not only is an honest society important to hong kong 's status and reputation as an international financial centre , but it is also of substantial significance to hong kong 's international economic and trading activities and its local economic development . the investors do not have to resort to " back doors " , bribery or other improper means to grease the palms of officials in order to obtain some benefits that they are not entitled to have , thus breaking the order of society . these unscrupulous means are totally unacceptable to us , and to any civilized and modern society . a lot of my friends in the business field have , from time to time , told me that " the advantage of hong kong is the icac " . and many people also told me that they appreciated the work so far done by the icac . there is no doubt that the image of the icac is already well - established in the community and is an anti-corruption institution widely respected by the public . mr president , a survey conducted among foreign businessmen in 12 countries and regions in asia in early april this year shows that china has the most serious problem of corruption in asia . hong kong ranks the tenth , not as good as japan and singapore . according to the findings of a public opinion survey conducted by the icac last year , more than 70% of the respondents thought that the problem of corruption would be more serious after 1997 , while 50% of the respondents thought that corruption as it is would get worse with the approaching of 1997 . it is beyond doubt that corruption prevention and combatting will be the main task of hong kong in the future . the icac needs sufficient and effective statutory authority to carry out this statutory duty of fighting corruption . however , at the same time , with the implementation of the hong kong bill of rights ordinance and the alex tsui incident leading to the question concerning the jurisdiction of the icac , it is necessary that we should review the powers of the icac to see whether they are excessive or if there is any insufficiency in any aspects or whether checks and balances are needed in certain areas so that appropriate amendments can be made to the law accordingly . at the end of 1994 when the review was completed , the icac review committee announced some recommendations which involved the amendment of the prevention of bribery ordinance and the independent commission against corruption ordinance . our amendments to the prevention of bribery ordinance today are mostly based on the recommendations in that review report . the purpose is to have a better legal framework in order to provide the icac with sufficient and effective authority to carry out its anti-corruption work . on the other hand , for the protection of human rights , basic freedoms , as well as the freedom of the press , we have to put in place a mechanism in the existing legislation to prevent the icac from abusing its powers , especially when recently , some businessmen are worried that the icac may become a tool of the chief executive of the future hong kong special administrative region in dealing with political dissidents or economic opponents . besides , in regard to section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance , a provision which restricts the disclosure of cases under icac investigation , both the administration 's proposed stipulation and amendment are far too stringent . it is our view that they will strike a blow at the freedom of the press and will also prevent the news media from playing the role of supervising the government . during the committee stage , i will put forward some related amendments and will explain in detail the reasons for my doing so . the present amendment to the prevention of bribery ordinance is a significant legal reform . we have to strike a reasonable balance between empowering the icac and protecting human rights . the democratic party hopes that this reform can boost public confidence in their continuous support to the work of the icac and help hong kong maintain an honest are just society before and beyond 1997 . nevertheless , there is still room for improvement in the present amendment . for instance , we are still unable to reach a consensus in regard to setting the criteria for the list of public bodies to be included in the prevention of bribery ordinance , nor can we agree on some legal principles for the corresponding amendment in the legislation in order that those public institutions receiving public donations and government subvention will also be subject to the restriction of this ordinance . it is regrettable that the above cannot be amended and incorporated in the schedule of the ordinance . the democratic party will follow up the review work concerned . we hope that in the next session of the legislative council , we can discuss with the administration in due course on whether some appropriate amendments can be made . mr president , owing to the reasons i have just mentioned , the democratic party supports the resumption of the second reading of the prevention of bribery ( miscellaneous provisions ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1995 . we are in support of the basic principles and spirit underlying this reform of the law as well as the amendments ( except the one regarding section 30 ) put forward by the administration . we hope that with the enactment of the bill , the icac can enter a new era . we also wish the icac , in the future after the return of hong kong to the motherland and as they enter the cross - century working stage , continued success in carrying out their duties positively , seriously and bravely , like what they did in the past , in order to achieve better results and to establish and strengthen an honest culture and reputation for hong kong . these are my remarks . thank you , mr president . mrs selina chow : mr president , this is the conclusive episode to the sequence of events which flowed from the dismissal of alex tsui , public inquiry conducted by the security panel of this council which reflected queries raised by the public on the dismissal and the appointment of the review committee which led to reforms to the commission which are now contained in the bill . the process of thorough vetting in the bills committee is in my view competent in adding the public dimension to the bill through the amendments . the liberal party , by and large , agrees with the bills committee 's conclusions regarding the administration 's proposed prevention of bribery ( miscellaneous provisions ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1995 with its latest set of committee stage amendments , with the exception of the intended amendment for section 30 (1) under the new clause 13a . i shall therefore be moving my own amendment to this clause . i would like to explain my reasons for moving this amendment , and also the liberal party 's reasons for not supporting the amendment proposed by mr albert ho . section 30 deals with restrictions on disclosure of information relating to investigations . we believe that the legislation needs to establish the right balance between the public 's right to know on the one hand , and the safeguard of the integrity of investigations as well as the adequate protection of reputations on the other . we oppose mr albert ho 's amendment which introduces the " likely to prejudice " test to offending disclosures . as was pointed out in the privy council ruling on the ming pao case , the difficulty with such a test is , and i quote , " in many cases it will be impossible to know whether disclosure has prejudiced an investigation or not " . and it goes on to say , " for the same reason the suggestion that the desired aim could have been achieved by qualifying the second limb subsection with some such words as " likely to prejudice the investigation " fails because of the difficulty of establishing when a disclosure satisfied the test . if the restriction is to be effective it cannot draw distinctions between prejudicing and non-prejudicing disclosures nor have regard to the state of mind of the disclosure . " we agree with their lordships that the " likely to prejudice " test would render the restriction on disclosure of the investigation in question ineffective , and thereby risk prejudicing the investigation as well as unnecessarily causing damage to reputation to the subject person . i would now like to come to my amendment to section 30 (1) . in fact my amendment is exactly the same as the one proposed by the administration before the privy council ruling . it liberalizes the existing state of things by : ( a ) limiting the application of section 30 to offences under part ii of the ordinance ; and , ( b ) narrowing the application of this subsection so that the offence is triggered if the person who discloses does so knowing or suspecting that an investigation of a part ii offence is taking place . following the privy council ruling , the administration substituted another amendment for section 30 (1) which aims to extend the restriction on disclosure to general investigation where no identifiable suspect has yet been named . the commissioner of the independent commission against corruption argues that such an amendment is to , in his words , " restore the section to one which protects investigations " . we beg to differ . we see the latest amendment by the administration not as a restoration to an accepted interpretation , but rather an expansion of the scope of the present law . we regard the existing provision as clear and beyond ambiguity , and accept the privy council 's interpretation of it as entirely sensible . it is , and should have always been , applied to only those investigations where a suspect has been identified . we do not believe the shroud of secrecy is justified for fishing expeditions and general intelligence gathering . i shall therefore be proposing the amendment initially submitted by the administration in order to proceed with the liberalization intended before the privy council ruling . mr ip kwok - him : mr president , the amendment to section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance ( pobo ) is deemed the most controversial part of this amendment bill . the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong ( dab ) is of the view that the prevalence of the sense of honesty in the society of hong kong is purely attributed to an independent , efficient team of anti-graft officers . at present , the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) exercises its powers by virtue of the pobo . section 30 of the pobo , which is alleged to have restricted freedom of the press , has , in fact , been put into force long before the establishment of the icac . with the changes in society and as the public has attached more and more importance to press freedom , it is indeed necessary to relax the provisions in the pobo . yet , if we give the matter some more thoughts , we will find that the spirit of formulating this piece of legislation is to protect and prevent the investigations of the icac from being impeded by unwarranted obstacles caused by the disclosure of information relating to investigations , be it a general or a higher - level investigation of an identified suspect . the underlying concerns of the government which have prompted the formulation of this clause are not totally unjustified . it is especially so at this point in time when people working in the media are trying hard to dig up exclusive news as a result of fierce competition in the market . any mishandling of such information obtained by the media may interfere with and subsequently delay or even ruin the work of the icac . now , is this a scenario that we would like to see as a consequence ? mr president , the dab thinks that given the sensitivity and the significant implications of the work of the icac , the protection of information relating to investigations should be taken as a matter of utmost concern . from the perspective of safeguarding the progress of investigations and considering the reputation of the parties concerned , coverage by the media may cause unwarranted impacts on investigations and the persons involved . in fact , the government has worked strenuously to strike a balance between press freedom and confidentiality of investigations . the government 's proposals show that whilst observing the bottom line that the work of investigations ought to be protected , the government has made considerable concessions and improvements in respect of the relaxation of restrictions on media reports . besides , in order to prevent the powers of the icac from becoming overextended and unregulated , the government has also proposed that the media may defend their disclosure of information pertaining to investigations on account of the involvement of icac officers in illegal activities , serious dereliction of duties and misconduct on the part of icac officers , as well as situations which pose a serious threat to social order , security and public health , as a way to check and balance and to monitor the powers of the icac . the dab agrees that the protection and defence of freedom of the press requires the concerted effort of the public . yet , certain constraints ought to be imposed in order to prevent the society from being adversely affected as a whole . mr president , i so submit . mr bruce liu : mr president , the association for democracy and people 's livelihood ( adpl ) supports the honourable mrs selina chow 's amendment to section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance . we also support most of the justifications put forward by her just now , particularly her reason for not supporting the amendment of the honourable albert ho . the adpl is of the view that anti-corruption legislation should strike a balance between the people 's right to know on the one hand and the investigation powers of the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) in the execution of duties as well as the need to protect the subject under investigation , in particular , the reputation of the innocent people on the other . however , the criterion of " likely to prejudice an investigation " as proposed by mr albert ho fails to achieve the right balance , nor can it enable the discloser ( in particular the media ) , when considering disclosing certain information , to provide adequate assurance that icac investigations on corruption could be conducted in a fair and just manner . as stated in the judgement of the privy council on the ming pao case , the suggestion that the desired aim could have been achieved by including in the provision such words as " likely to prejudice an investigation " will not work . this is because it is difficult to establish when a disclosure satisfied the " likely to prejudice " test . if the restriction is to be effective , there should be no distinction between prejudicial and non-prejudicial disclosures . we strongly support that the judgement of the privy council should be upheld . therefore , we do not support the amendment of mr albert ho . i also think that the amendment of mr albert ho fails to effectively protect the reputation of the subject under investigation . the law should particularly provide for an explicit criteria in order to tell the discloser , in particular the media , under what circumstances the disclosure of icac investigations is prohibited . such criterion should be set out in clear terms and should be easily comprehensible so as to prevent reporters , compelled by market competition , from disclosing information pertaining to investigations , especially those relating to the innocent people . the second point i would like to add is that the amendment of mrs selina chow can , by comparison , can set people 's mind at rest . it specifies that only when a person discloses the fact that icac has an identified subject of investigation , then the disclosure will constitute an offence . this is an express principle to base on and is worthy of support . after making comparisons , the adpl would support the amendment of the honourable miss christine loh because it explicitly sets out six circumstances under which disclosure of icac investigations is allowed . they are very clear principles to follow . under these six circumstances , it is believed that the icac investigation should already be in a relatively mature or very mature stage and has an identified subject of investigation , in which case the investigation powers of the icac will not be severely impeded . this is the way to strike the right balance . lastly , the adpl does not think that the government 's amendment will achieve the right balance as it will introduce improper restrictions on the public 's right to know and freedom of the press . therefore , the adpl opposes the government 's amendment to section 30 . thank you , mr president . attorney general : mr president , i wish to thank the chairman of the bills committee , the honourable james to , and members of the committee for their thorough scrutiny of this important bill . the debate in the chamber this afternoon , serious and high - minded , underscores the importance this council and the community attaches to the work of the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) while reflecting proper concerns over checks and balances over the use of the icac 's powers . i am pleased that almost all issues of concern to the bills committee have been resolved to the satisfaction of members . the administration has agreed to a number of committee stage amendments , which i will be moving later this afternoon . the committee stage amendments mr president , i will now describe the major amendments to the bill . i will propose that clause 1 should be amended so that the ordinance will come into operation on a date to be appointed by notice in the gazette , by virtue of section 20 subsection (3) of the interpretation and general clauses ordinance , it will be possible for different dates to be fixed for different provisions . the icac will need some lead - time before some of the new provisions can be brought into operation . this is the case , for example , where the provisions require court applications to be made . members of the bills committee have , however , asked me to undertake to bring all provisions into effect as soon as practicable , and i agree to do so . clause 4 is to be amended so that further restrictions are placed on the commissioner 's powers of investigation under section 13 of the prevention of bribery ordinance . that section enables the commissioner to require persons to produce certain documents . the chairman of the bills committee had proposed that the powers under section 13 should be subject to court control . the administration considers that a distinction should be made between requirements imposed under the section directed at suspects , and those directed at third parties , such as banks . where a suspect is required to disclose a document , he may be required , in effect , to incriminate himself . this being so , we accept that there is a case for imposing court control over such requirements . however , we do not believe that there is any similar justification for requiring a court order before third parties can be required to produce documents relating to a suspect . moreover , precedents exist in the securities and futures commission ordinance and the companies ordinance for a power to require the production of documents without any court control . the committee stage amendment in respect of section 13 therefore imposes court control over requirements directed at a suspect . it also restricts the scope of section 13: - by restoring to section 14 ( and therefore imposing court control over ) the power to require a person in charge of a public body to furnish documents to the icac ; - by deleting references to safe - deposit boxes ; and - by introducing a requirement that there must be reasonable cause to believe that the documents to be produced are " likely to be relevant " for the purposes of the investigation . the administration believes the amendments proposed will achieve the twin objects of : - introducing court control where it is appropriate ; and - ensuring that icac investigations can continue to be undertaken effectively and in confidence . the committee stage amendments to clause 5 of the bill relate to new section 13a of the prevention of bribery ordinance . that section would have enabled any icac investigating officer to make an application to the high court for an order requiring the commissioner of inland revenue to produce to the icac material held by him . the proposed amendments limit the persons who may make such an application ; provide that applications lie to the high court in chambers ; and set out further guidelines to the court in deciding whether it is in the public interest to make such an order . further amendments to clause 5 are proposed in the form of a new section 13c . this new section reflects the concern , expressed by the honourable eric li , that confidential information about a taxpayer that is held by the commissioner of inland revenue may be obtained by the icac and publicly revealed in a subsequent prosecution . i wish to emphasize here that the bill will permit the disclosure of inland revenue information obtained by the icac only for the purposes of proceedings relating to , or any prosecution of an offence , under the prevention of bribery ordinance . i can assure members that the information may not be otherwise disclosed . the proposed new section 13c will apply where it is intended to use such information for those purposes . it will enable the taxpayer , and the person who may have supplied the information to the commissioner of inland revenue , to apply to the court for an order preventing the identity of the taxpayer from being publicly revealed . the court , when deciding whether to make such an order , will be required to consider whether the public interest in the publication of such information is outweighed by the privacy and confidentiality of the information , the prejudice that might result from publication , and the public interest in preserving the secrecy of tax information . this approach is , i suggest , a good way of dealing with the competing interests at stake , and i am grateful to the honourable eric li for drawing attention to the problem and in assisting in finding a solution . the proposed amendments to clause 6 ( a ) of the bill relate to the power under section 14 of the prevention of bibery ordinance to obtain information . the bill subjects those powers to court control . the committee stage amendments provide that an application to the court for authority to use the powers is to be made in chambers , and prohibit the court from authorizing the use of certain of the powers unless the information sought is likely to be relevant to the corruption investigation or proceedings . it is essential that applications to the court under the section are handled in confidence , and i will be raising with the judiciary how this can be best achieved . the proposed amendment to clause 6 ( b ) of the bill restores to section 14 the power to require a person in charge of a public body to furnish documents to the icac . the effect of this amendment is that the power will become subject to court control . the proposed amendment to clause 10 ( a ) provides that the powers of search under section 17 of the prevention of bribery ordinance can only be exercised if the court or the commissioner is " satisfied " of relevant matters , rather than if it " appears to " them that this is the case . a new clause 14a is to be added to the bill . this is a savings provision to ensure that notices already served under section 14a or 14c of the prevention of bribery ordinance will continue in effect notwithstanding the repeal of the former section and the amendment to the latter . it also has the effect that extensions of such notices are subject to court control . mr president , i now turn to section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance , on which so much has been said and written , and on which the bills committee spent much anxious time . section 30 makes it an offence for a person , without lawful authority or reasonable excuse , to disclose details of an investigation in respect of an offence alleged or suspected to have been committed under the ordinance . the bill , as introduced , proposed no amendment to section 30 . the bill , as members will recall , was introduced to give effect to those recommendations of the icac review committee which required legislation . the review committee proposed no change to section 30 , which had been amended by this council in 1992 to ensure consistency with the bill of rights ordinance . the review committee was satisfied that section 30 achieved the right balance . but that view was not shared by members of the bills committee as we have heard this afternoon . however , it is significant , mr president , to note that , after exhaustive deliberations , no member of the bills committee has suggested that section 30 should be repealed . but the bills committee was not able to reach agreement with the administration over the way in which the section should be amended . as a result , i will be moving two committee stage amendments in respect of the section and three members , as we have heard , will move their own amendments . i will say more about all these proposed amendments when the bill is in committee stage . but , mr president , i cannot leave section 30 without responding briefly to the suggestion made by a member that the ming pao prosecution was an abuse of power . i would like to refute that suggestion as being completely unfounded . the prosecution was properly brought based on the view of the evidence and the law as it was then thought to be . there was no abuse of power by the icac . there was no abuse of the prosecution process . the committee stage amendments will also contain amendments to the bill 's provisions in respect of the independent commission against corruption ordinance , to which i now turn . clause 15 of the bill relates to the power to dismiss icac officers under section 8 of that ordinance . the clause is to be amended so that , before terminating an appointment , the commissioner must consult the advisory committee on corruption . the report of the icac review committee recommended that this should be the case , and the administration has agreed that this recommendation should be reflected in the legislation . clause 16 of the bill is to be amended to reflect the fact that , since the bill was gazetted , an authentic chinese version of the independent commission against corruption ordinance has been produced . a new clause 16b is to be added , amending section 10d of the icac ordinance . that section enables the icac to take fingerprints , photographs and measurements of persons arrested under section 10 . the bill will enable the icac , if it wishes , to serve a summons on a person , instead of arresting him or her . this being so , it is considered appropriate that the icac should have the power to take fingerprints , photographs and measurements of a person on whom a summons is served . the committee stage amendment so provides . clause 17 of the bill amends section 13 (2) of the icac ordinance so that , in order to perform his corruption - prevention duties , the commissioner may gain access to documents held by public bodies . the bills committee was concerned , as we have heard , that this power might be too broad and so the administration has agreed to limit the power so that it applies only to documents that an authorized icac officer reasonably considers will reveal the practices and the procedures of the public body . the committee stage amendments also include drafting improvements to the bill . the amendment to clause 7 , and the proposed new clauses 12a and 16a , are cases in point . conclusion mr president , when i introduced this bill into the council , i described it as an essential step in reaffirming the icac 's mandate in the light of present day circumstances and the changing expectations of the people of hong kong . the administration is pleased that , subject to the committee stage amendments that i have referred to , the bill has received the support of the bills committee . the enactment of this bill will therefore indeed be a strong reaffirmation of the icac 's mandate as it continues its vital work in the years ahead . thank you , mr president .

industrial undertakings ( amendment ) bill 1996 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 22 may 1996 mr edward ho : mr president , i shall speak in the capacity of chairman of the bills committee to study the factories and industrial undertakings ( amendment ) bill 1996 . the purpose of the bill is to empower the commissioner for labour to issue improvement notices and suspension notices to proprietors of industrial undertakings . in view of the recent spate of industrial accidents , i believe that members , the administration and the general public are all very concerned about the importance of industrial safety and hope that the relevant legislation can be passed as soon as possible . it was at such a time that the bills committee was charged with the responsibility to study this bill in detail . having been hard pressed for time , the bills committee held four meetings with the administration and various deputations over the past fortnight . i would now give a general account of some major issues of concern raised by committee members . in general , members of the bills committee supported the proposal to issue improvement notices . however , concern has been expressed as to whether the proprietor , who is issued with an improvement notice , would still be prosecuted for breaches of the respective provisions . the administration has indicated that under normal circumstances , if an improvement notice is complied with , prosecution would not be taken out for such breaches . i hope that the secretary for manpower and education will further confirm this point in his reply . as for suspension notices , members were given to understand that in actual operations , should a factory inspector of the labour department ( ld ) discover a hazard during an inspection visit , he would warn the proprietor verbally on the spot and report the situation to his senior . the issue of a suspension notice has to be approved by a deputy chief factory inspector of the ld . this three - tier control arrangement may give rise to a certain time lapse between the inspection visit and the actual serving of the suspension notice . in response to this point of concern , the government agreed to revise the guidelines so that a suspension notice could be issued as soon as practicable and in any case not later than 24 hours after the inspection . committee members generally considered that a verbal warning was not adequate as part of the procedures ; rather the proposed section 9c should be duly amended to provide that prior to the issue of a suspension notice , the visiting inspector should first issue to the proprietor on the spot a written notice stating the intention to issue a suspension notice on him and specifying the circumstances which warranted such notice . a written notice will enable the proprietor to understand fully the hazard concerned and take necessary remedial action . the administration did not object to the proposed arrangement but has refused to include this into the law . therefore , i will move the necessary amendments at the committee stage to have this arrangement included in the ordinance . i will further explain on this point at the committee stage . as regards the review by the commissioner for labour within 14 days of the issue of suspension notices , some deputations and committee members questioned whether it was an appropriate procedural arrangement for the commissioner to consult the industrial safety and health committee ( ishc ) , which was only a sub-committee under the labour advisory board rather than a full statutory body . as for the time required for the review , the administration indicated it was prepared to give the proprietor a choice . should he choose not to refer his case to the ishc , the commissioner could determine his case within a shorter time . the administration has declined the suggestion put forward by some deputations to include the technical memorandum in the ordinance on the grounds that a technical memorandum should be used to list technical specifications instead of law enforcement guidelines . however , the administration agreed to publicize the procedural guidelines and also to maintain consultation with the parties concerned in finalizing or proposing major changes to these guidelines . the secretary for manpower and education may give a further explanation on this point when he speaks . committee members have also been advised that remedial action taken by the proprietor in response to an improvement notice or suspension notice would not necessarily be construed as self-incrimination , and some members thus asked whether a clause to this effect could be incorporated into the bill . having sought legal advice , the administration confirmed its policy position that such a clause would not be added as it was considered unnecessary . under the proposed system , the inspectorate staff of the ld will be required to take action promptly , notably in issuing suspension notices , in checking remedial action and also in rescinding suspension notices where necessary . the bills committee has already requested the administration to make the necessary staffing arrangements to ensure timely actions could be taken . lastly , i would like to thank all members of the bills committee for their co-operation in making the speedy deliberation of this bill possible . mr president , with these remarks , i support the bill . miss chan yuen - han : mr president , we are always in support of any measure or policy to promote prevention of industrial accidents . this bill empowers the commissioner for labour to issue improvement and suspension notices to improve industrial safety measures . from the standpoint of protecting the lives of workers , members from the federation of trade unions ( ftu ) , myself included , are naturally duty - bound to support the administration . mr president , under the present situation , even if the commissioner for labour has reasons to believe that the workers concerned are exposed to immediate danger , he has no authority at all to suspend any work or operation . he has to apply to the court for a suspension of works order but this will at least take some ten days before it can be issued . in the meantime , serious industrial accidents may happen . therefore , this bill addresses this problem and helps to reduce the occurrence of industrial accidents . at a meeting of the bills committee , members discussed the procedure of issuing suspension notices by the government . the government official at the meeting clearly stated that if a factory inspector , in the course of inspection , noted a hazardous situation , he would give a verbal warning on the spot . he would send a written warning later on and would report the case to his superior before a suspension notice was to be served . however , this procedure would not be written into the ordinance but would be handled with flexibility . in response , some of my colleagues in this council have moved amendments with a view to incorporating this procedure into the ordinance . both the ftu and i do not agree with this proposal , as this will " bind the hands " of the government when actually dealing with the case , directly or indirectly affecting the inspection work of a group of professional factory inspectors and also affecting to a certain extent the prevention of industrial accidents . moreover , mr president , i have to make it clear that when i say " binding the hands " , i do not actually mean binding the hands of the government . what i mean is that this will endanger the health and safety of the workers at work . on this major premise , my colleagues from the ftu and i will not support the amendments in this regard moved by my colleagues in this council . the ftu reckons that since the factory inspectors already have a handbook to follow concerning the issue of written notices , it is not necessary for them to act according to the views of some honourable members , which will only provide more legal loopholes for the contractors concerned and will be detrimental rather than beneficial at all to any worker at work . mr president , at a meeting of the bills committee , some honourable members proposed that if the proprietor concerned had already complied with the requirement of the labour department in rectifying the hazardous situation , this should by no means be construed as " self-incrimination " . the amendment moved by some honourable members in this respect cannot be accepted by the ftu . it is because this is not in line with legal principles , as was clearly pointed out by officials from the legal department , the labour department and the education and manpower branch . besides , the legal adviser of the legislative council also share the same view in this respect . mr president , as legislators ourselves , how can we support amendments which run counter to the advice given by legal professionals ? finally , i have to point out that the ftu will only support the administration 's technical amendment and the original bill . we appreciate that the administration has finally agreed to amend the internal procedure pertaining to the inspection of work sites by factory inspectors to ensure that suspension notices can be issued within 24 hours of the inspection , and to redeploy the manpower in response to the coming into effect of the legislation concerned . mr president , with these remarks , members from the ftu , myself included , will support the motion of the administration . thank you . mr michael ho : mr president , the democratic party has all along been striving for better labour laws , hoping that safety at workplaces can be improved through amending the laws . we support the bill to amend the factories and industrial undertakings ordinance . the bill makes it possible for the commissioner for labour to issue suspension notices , which previously could only be issued by the court . this is a marked improvement in that relevant notices can now be more readily issued , making it more convenient to effectively improve safety at workplaces . now that suspension and improvement notices can be issued at the earliest possibility , we hope the government will , through adopting administrative measures and allowing flexibility , shorten as far as possible the time taken to issue such notices . we do appreciate that the government has undertaken to reduce the time required to issue suspension notices from 48 hours to 24 hours . however , we very much hope that the time can be further shortened to much shorter than 24 hours in future . the government will also replace verbal suspension warning with written notification . this is acceptable to us and we agree that it should be implemented as an administrative procedure . we agree that the administrative procedure is good enough to protect the workers and is fair to the employers . we will support the technical amendments put forward by the secretary for education and manpower but will not support those put forward by the honourable ronald arculli and the honourable edward ho . as regards the wording of the relevant amendments , we will be speaking on it again at the committee stage . thank you , mr president . mr ronald arculli : mr president , before i deal in substance with the amendment , that is , the bill before the council today , i would like to make one point quite clear . in the course of the bills committee 's deliberation of this particular bill , it transpired that the present procedure requires the commissioner for labour to actually attend court to obtain a suspension of works order . but no application has been made to court since the early eighties . we were told that the reason is because of the procedure is cumbersome and time consuming . it is no wonder that the labour sector is unhappy with that state of affairs and welcome the present amendment proposed in the present bill . indeed , mr president , i rise to speak in support of the bill . but , firstly , i must chastise the government for not bringing this measure in sooner . my colleague , the honourable edward ho has outlined the purpose of the bill and indeed some of the concerns expressed by my constituents in the property and construction sectors . their concerns are not with the introduction of the improvement or suspension notices . their concerns reflect what i believe to be the shortcomings in the bill which were revealed in the course of and as a result of scrutiny by the bills committee . i will try to outline these concerns as briefly as i can . first , in the course of scrutiny , we were informed by the administration that in respect of a suspension notice , it would be issued subject to a three - tier administrative control . in brief , whenever a factory inspector discovers any imminent risk of serious bodily injury he should immediately but verbally warn the management of the industrial undertaking and report the situation to the divisional factory inspector who , after assessing the situation , would forward his recommendations to a deputy chief inspector for approval to issue a suspension notice . in the original draft guidelines , the labour department stated that the suspension notice will be served as soon as practicable but in no case later than two working days . on probing by the bills committee , this was reduced to the 24 hours as everyone in this chamber has heard , as well as the labour department accepting that the verbal warning should be in writing although by an administrative measure . mr president , members of the bills committee were unable to persuade the administration that this written notice should be a statutory requirement rather than an administrative measure . the reasons advanced by the secretary for education and manpower , in his letter dated 9 july this year to members of this council , are that it is unnecessary , unacceptable and will impose an undue burden on the proprietors and on the administration . mr president , what i cannot understand is why does the administration want to avoid making statutory what it is otherwise prepared to do anyway ? the only difference is that all the proprietors , and indeed all the workers , will know where their rights are and if this is set out in the law so much the better . we are being asked to give the commissioner for labour a pretty tough legal power to use these notices . i would have thought that the commissioner would welcome this clear - cut requirement . mr president , the honourable edward ho mentioned that there was concern over the need for a 14 - day period for the commissioner to review the issue of a suspension notice . on being queried why such a lengthy period was required , the bills committee was told by the labour department that the commissioner intended to consult with the committee on industrial safety and health which is a subcommittee of the labour advisory board . it seems extraordinary that the commissioner would embark on such an exercise outside the scope of the bill and indeed the ordinance , however well - intentioned these consultations may be . i made the point during our deliberations that if that were the case , what the commissioner should do is to actually include this process in the relevant subsection in the bill and that it would receive the support of this council . but alas the administration 's response is that it was up to the bills committee to decide . i resisted using emotive remakes , but it does seem astonishing that in the exercise of a statutory power to review a suspension notice , the commissioner intends to consult with a non-statutory committee and probably in the absence of the applicant . this may well explain why the administration feels that a statutory notice is unnecessary , unacceptable and an undue burden . mr president , i shall deal with another concern which in simple terms is simply this : what is the effect of compliance with an improvement or suspension notice ? the way in which the commissioner is empowered to issue these notices , to say the least , implies that a contravention of the ordinance is occurring or has occurred . hence there is some doubt as to whether compliance by the proprietor with such notices can amount to evidence against him in any criminal or disciplinary proceedings . it seems to me that the policy objective of the government must be to encourage compliance with such notices . but would this be achieved if there is a concern that compliance could be used as evidence against such proprietor ? it is common sense that it will discourage rather than encourage compliance . my proposed amendment therefore is to preclude the act of compliance as being evidence . mr president , i hasten to add that my proposed amendment is not intended to and does not preclude a prosecution or disciplinary proceedings . it simply excludes compliance as evidence of contravention . if there is cogent evidence of contravention and in serious cases , i am sure the commissioner may well prosecute or indeed instigate disciplinary proceedings . i am not seeking to prevent that . indeed you would expect that there would be other evidence to support the issue of the notices anyway . my proposed amendment , contrary to the secretary for education and manpower 's assertion , would not and cannot undermine efforts to bring to justice offending proprietors in serious cases . mr president , the choice for members is clean and simple : encourage compliance by supporting my amendment without affecting criminal or disciplinary proceedings . in conclusion , mr president , my constituents , the real estate developers association and the hong kong construction association support the spirit behind the bill . like this council , they are conscious of the urgency of this bill and attended meetings to ensure its quick resolution . all they seek is clear and fair amendments and not to leave major issues to administrative measures as asserted by the administration . is that really too much to ask ? i believe not ! mr president , i hope members of this council will support my amendments . mr lee cheuk - yan : mr president , i support the bill moved by the government . i clearly recall that in 1984 when i was still working for the association for the rights of industrial victims , i did point out that the government needed the power to issue notices for the suspension of works but the government , as i recall , replied at the time that it was already empowered to apply for an injunction from a magistracy . i am very happy with the performance of the government at the meetings of the bills committees and it can be said that the mistake the government made in the past is well remedied by the action it takes now , for the administration admitted that they did not actually exercise this power to obtain an injunction from a magistracy . it was due to the highly cumbersome procedures involved that it never exercised such power . my view is that as this bill , if carried , will empower factory inspectors to issue suspension notices , it can be said that workers in hong kong will be in possession of a " golden plaque exempting them from death " . it is because the bill seeks to enable government factory inspectors to issue suspension notices should they think the situation may entail imminent risk or possible injuries . we believe that if the administration is empowered to issue suspension notices and if the contractors concerned will comply with such notices , it is tantamount to bestowing on the workers a " golden plaque exempting them from death " because the procedures in question , though still in progress , will have to be suspended . yet , it does not mean a halt in the entire operation of the construction site , as only a certain procedure will have to be suspended . therefore , we consider this bill vitally important . it is my hope that , with the passage of this bill , factory inspectors will be conferred the powers to suspend more effectively , during inspections , procedures which tend to cause bodily harm to workers or those which entail dangers . the honourable ronald arculli mentioned earlier that at the meetings of the bills committee , people in the trade criticized the government 's proposal to consult the committee on industrial safety and health of the labour advisory board ( lab ) in the course of appeal . as i was there at the meeting of the committee on industrial safety and health at the time , i would like to clarify here that it was not the labour representatives who proposed consultation with the lab . it was the employers ' representatives who did so . it was the employers ' representatives who wanted the government to consult the lab . in fact , the position of the labour representatives is , in essence , to ensure that the administration can issue suspension notices which can subsequently command compliance from the employers . in the case of an appeal , be it lodged to the commissioner for labour or the administrative appeals board , for the workers it is still a means to figure things out in either case . therefore , i have to clarify this point . just now mr ronald arculli said they are dissatisfied and failed to see why the commissioner for labour , who are granted this statutory power , has to consult a non-statutory body . here , i would like to tell members that it was in fact the employers who wanted the inclusion of this procedure . i believe the government will later offer an explanation by saying that the problem has already been tackled by allowing employers or contractors served with suspension notices to choose whether the matter would be passed to and handled by the committee of industrial safety and health of the lab . the government believes that if they choose not to have the matter handled by the committee , it will not take such a lengthy period as 14 days to reach a decision . i think the government will explain this matter to members . with regard to the amendment of mr ronald arculli and that of the honourable edward ho , i oppose them both and will state my reasons at the committee stage . thank you , mr president . secretary for education and manpower : mr president , first of all , i would like to thank the members of the bills committee , under the chairmanship of the honourable edward ho , for their speedy deliberation of and support for the bill . the factories and industrial undertakings ( amendment ) bill 1996 seeks to empower the commissioner for labour to issue a suspension notice for the removal of a possible imminent danger to workers , and to issue an improvement notice for remedial action to be taken in the case of a less hazardous situation . this is a piece of important legislation concerning industrial safety which empowers the commissioner for labour to take prompt preventive and law enforcing actions . later on i will move three amendments to the bill standing in my name , which are all of a simple technical nature and have secured the support of the bills committee of this council . however , mr edward ho and the honourable ronald arculli have given notice to move some substantive amendments , which the government considers to be unnecessary and inappropriate . the proposed amendment by mr edward ho requires the commissioner for labour , upon discovering any circumstances that warrant the issue of a suspension notice , to serve on the proprietor of the relevant industrial undertaking a written notice stating the authorities ' intention to issue a suspension notice and the matters to be specified in that suspension notice . the first part of mr arculli 's proposal , which is the same as mr ho 's proposed amendment , requests the commissioner for labour to serve a notice on the proprietor of the relevant industrial undertaking . only mr arculli further proposes that the notice should be set out in a prescribed form and the commissioner for labour can revise the form by publishing a notice in the gazette . in fact , the government has agreed to specify in the labour department 's procedural guidelines on the issuance of a suspension notice that the proprietor of an industrial undertaking would be informed in writing of the government 's intention to issue a suspension notice . the government opposes these amendments because not only will they turn an administrative procedure into a statutory requirement but also according to mr arculli 's proposal , the form and content of the notice , which should be of an administrative nature , will be prescribed by statute . the proposed amendments would therefore severely weaken the flexibility to respond to urgent cases which is much needed by the commissioner for labour in dealing with situations involving life and death issues . the second part of mr arculli 's proposal is to exclude the compliance with an improvement notice or a suspension notice as evidence against a proprietor . this is totally unacceptable to the government because it will undermine the government 's efforts to bring offending proprietors in serious cases to justice . later on i will explain in detail the government 's argument against these amendments . i urge members to vote against the amendments proposed by mr edward ho and mr arculli . i can assure members that the commissioner for labour has drawn up detailed guidelines on the circumstances under which suspension notices and improvement notices can be issued and the procedures to be followed when issuing or rescinding such notices . the government is scrutinizing these guidelines to ensure that they are adequate to prevent any possible abuse of power and are in line with statutory requirements and the customary legal and administrative practices . if this bill can pass through the legislative council , the commissioner for labour will publish these guidelines when the bill comes into effect . we will review the effectiveness of these guidelines from time to time . should substantial amendments be required , the commissioner for labour will consult the groups concerned through the existing consultation mechanism . the groups to be consulted will include the labour advisory board ( lab ) and its expert committees , the occupational safety and health council and the employers ' associations and trade unions concerned . in discussing the recommendations contained in the bill , the lab suggested that the commissioner for labour should consult the industrial safety and health committee ( ishc ) under the lab when deciding on an application for review under section 9c (4) . the commissioner for labour has accepted lab 's suggestion because the ishc is an expert committee which consists of an equal number of representatives from the employers ' and the employees ' groups as well as a number of safety professionals . members of the bills committee consider that some proprietors may not need the advice of the ishc . in view of this , the commissioner for labour has agreed that whether advice would be sought from the ishc was to be determined according to the wish of the applicant for the review . in scrutinizing the bill , legislative council members and members of the bills committee have expressed great concern about some issues . my colleagues have discussed these opinions in detail at the committee meetings . i would like to respond to some of the more major issues here . members of the bills committee and some representatives concerned have pointed out that as the purpose of a suspension notice was to safeguard the life and safety of the workers , the notice should be issued immediately after a dangerous situation was discovered . on the other hand , as the issuance of the notice would hinder the progress of the work , it should be rescinded as soon as the problem relating to the dangerous situation was solved . in view of this , we have promised that a suspension notice would be issued or rescinded as fast as practicable by the commission for labour . in any case , it should be issued no later than 24 hours after a danger has been noticed and be rescinded no later than 24 hours after remedial action has been properly taken . thank you , mr president . question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . aviation security bill resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 5 june 1996 mr howard young : the aviation security bill , as laid before this council is , a bill which is necessary for hong kong and has the support of the aviation industry , which is part of the tourism industry which i represent . hong kong has had a good track record for many , many years as being a safe , secure place to carry out aviation business and aviation activities . and that has enhanced hong kong 's reputation as an aviation and communications centre in this part of the world . for historical reasons , aviation security , which to the layman deals with things such as hijacking of aircraft and the protection of passengers and aircraft , has been under the umbrella of united kingdom civil aviation legislation which now , with the transfer of sovereignty , it is proper and correct that such laws should be localized to be implemented in hong kong beyond 1997 . whilst the bill itself has the support of the industry , i wish here to make one or two points which the industry which i represent is concerned with in relation to aviation security plus the main problem which this bill tries to address , that is , the commandeering of aircraft . although the bill deals with instances where aircraft may not be unlawfully taken over or commandeered in flight or at airports , there have been in recent years instances of where , for non-terrorist or reasons of hijacking and the like , passengers or people have in certain airports in the region have occupied aircraft unnecessarily whilst they are on the ground . such instances have happened in recent years in taipei and in manila and most of them , although they have nothing to do with the ambit of this bill in the sense of aviation security when it is related to hijacking or terrorist activities , in fact do have a side - effect of possibly affecting passenger and aircraft safety . we all know that aircraft , although they must be secure whilst they are in the air or on the ground for refuelling or transiting , must stick to strict schedules and must take off and land according to aviation and aircraft control procedures . if these are not adhered to , they could indirectly have a bad impact not just on commercial scheduling and commercial interests , but also on the air traffic control in general which indirectly could also impact on the security of aircraft and passengers waiting to land or take off . mr president , in this context , i have had discussions with the economic services branch , civil aviation department and security branch . whilst we all agreed that in the particular context of this bill , it may not be proper to actually try and insert clauses in this to also prohibit the commissioning of commandeering of aircraft without the consent of its operator 's owners whilst on the ground , there may be other measures to be taken such as when the administration discusses by - laws with the airport authority in particular in relation to the new airport to prevent such instances from marring hong kong 's reputation as an efficient and secure and safe aviation centre . in this respect , i hope that the government , after the passage of this bill , will not let the matter rest lightly . apart from these remarks , mr president , the industry which i represent does fully support the contents of the bill . secretary for security : mr president , the aviation security bill was introduced into the legislative council for its first and second readings on 5 june 1996 . the bill seeks to localize united kingdom legislative provisions , concerning international conventions on aviation security , which are currently extended to hong kong by orders - in - council . it also includes provisions to apply other internationally recommended aviation security measures which are currently being implemented in hong kong through administrative means . the enactment of the bill will enable us to establish a comprehensive statutory framework for implementing aviation security measures , now and beyond 1997 . our aim is to implement our aviation security requirements in co-operation and consultation with the aviation industry . to this end , we have widely consulted within the aviation industry including with the airlines , airport tenants and the airport authority . although it is not directly related to the bill , i wish to assure mr howard young that we are happy to continue with our consultation on any matters which ensure that we have the highest standard of effectiveness in operation of our airport as well as the highest standard in maintaining our security standards . i just wish to record my thanks for honourable members ' immediate support for this bill . with the passage of this bill , we shall be sending a very strong message to the international community that hong kong is meeting and will continue to meet internationally accepted aviation security standards and obligations . there are only a few technical amendments which i shall move later at the committee stage . mr president , i recommend the aviation security bill to this council . question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . immigration service ( amendment ) bill 1996 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 7 february 1996 miss emily lau : mr president , the government presented the immigration service ( amendment ) bill 1996 to the legislative council on 7 february this year and two days later , the house committee of this council decided to set up a bills committee to scrutinize the bill . the bills committee started its work on 29 march and i was elected chairman . altogether we had five meetings . mr president , the bill seeks to rationalize or extend the powers conferred on officers of the immigration service ( is ) for the investigation of offences relating to the registration of births and deaths , registration of marriages and registration of persons records as well as falsification of documents under the crimes ordinance . it is proposed in the bill that the investigation duties be transferred from the police to the immigration department . in the bill , it is proposed that the is should be fully responsible for investigating offences under their purview . at present , officers of the is have the powers to arrest , detain and search suspects as well as seize and remove things . however , their powers of investigation of offences relating to the registration of births and deaths , registration of marriages , registration of persons records and falsification of documents are not clearly defined . the is is empowered to conduct a preliminary investigation when such an offence arises . when prima facie evidence is established , then the case will have to be transferred to the police for full investigation and prosecution . the administration thinks that such a practice will result in overlapping of work and reduced efficiency . besides , for the purpose of relieving overcrowding at the detention cells in police stations , it is proposed in the bill that the is can decide whether the arrested person should be taken to a police station or be detained in an office of the is in order to facilitate further investigation . the administration has indicated that the vacant government offices building in ma tau kok road will be re-constructed . it is expected that the work will be completed in one year . by that time , the premises can be used to detain 90 people . in the long run , the administration has planned to set up a new detention centre with a capacity of 300 people to replace the existing victoria immigration centre . mr president , members are very concerned whether the new powers conferred on the is will be exercised in a proper way and under supervision . the administration said that training on investigation and detention of suspects has always been provided to the is and guidelines on the proper procedures for detaining a suspect in an office of the is will be issued . after the is has set up a detention centre , it will approach the police and the correctional services department for the necessary training to its staff . besides , the is will also issue guidelines on how to manage the detention centre . mr president , the administration has also promised that it will submit papers to the panel on security of this council in which it will set out in detail the training provided to the is , the guidelines it has drawn up and the complaints system it has set up to deal with complaints about any abuse of power from the public . when scrutinizing the bill , members were most concerned about issues relating to personal freedom . as a result , a provision stipulating the maximum detention period is included . mr president , what i referred to is " detention " , not " remand in custody " . it means the maximum time to be allowed in detaining a person for investigation . we discussed this for a long time . some members suggested that the maximum time should be two hours . but the government said that was impracticable because the officers concerned would have to count the time when doing investigation . but i remarked that if i were arrested , i would certainly count every second . so i believed it should be acceptable to ask the government to count every minute and every second it is spending in its work . mr president , finally members and the government agreed that detention under such circumstances should not exceed 12 hours . in addition to the above , there is a provision in the bill that a person shall not be searched by officers of the is in a public place if he objects to being so searched . this is different from what the police is doing now . if a police officer wants to stop and search a person in the street , that person has no right to object to being searched there . but according to this bill , officers of the is have to inform the people concerned that they have the right to object to being searched in the street and the government has agreed to put this down in the work procedures . officers of the is can take the person concerned to an office of the is , his home or a private place in order to do the search . members generally support this idea . i personally hope that the police can follow the practice of the is . nonetheless , mr president , this is only my personal opinion . the administration has accepted members ' suggestion to stipulate in the work procedures of the department concerned that investigators must inform the people who they are going to search that they have the right to object to being searched in a public place . this is because many people do not know their right in this respect and they are usually frightened when being stopped and searched in the street . so we hope officers of the is will remember this point and inform people of their right . mr president , the bills committee , after holding a number of discussions , has decided to support the bill and the amendment to be proposed by the secretary for security in the committee stage . with these remarks , i support the second reading of the bill . mr james to : mr president , the honourable miss emily lau has voiced our opinions on behalf of the bills committee . now i would like to make one or two supplementary points . i can foresee that after the enactment of this bill , officers of the immigration department will face greater challenges in carrying out their duties , and more conflicts will arise than the present investigation team when enforcing the law . since most of the resources and training in the immigration department are not aimed at conflict situations and are not designed for handling scenes that need to use force , i think the government should pay special attention to training in this area , including what skills should be adopted to handle problems . originally , the police force is responsible for the work in this area , and all police officers , no matter they are uniformed or plain - clothed , have already received comprehensive training which will enable them to tackle conflicts . these include detention , investigation , arrests and even intelligence work . therefore , i think the government should step up training for immigration department officers in this area . secondly , as what miss emily lau has said , the government has undertaken to discuss with us the mechanisms on receiving as well as monitoring complaints in the future . i understand that these departments may receive complaints because of conflict situations , but i expect not too many complaints will be heard at the outset because there will not be so many such incidents in this regard . i support in principle the establishment of a comprehensive and independent investigation mechanism , but it is not the most effective arrangement in terms of resources . nevertheless , i hope the government will make some positive proposals on how to monitor complaints , so that the public can also be satisfied that it is a just arrangement . since the immigration department is going to have more coercive power to handle possible conflict situations , and according to the experience of the police force , the ratio of complaints in this regard will gradually increase . it is therefore hoped that the government can put forward a proposal on an effective mechanism as soon as possible for our discussion . secretary for security : mr president , the lmmigration service ( amendment ) bill 1996 was introduced into the legislative council on 7 february this year . this bill seeks to give members of the immigration service powers of investigation into offences relating to registration matters under the purview of the immigration service , and into certain forgery offences under the crimes ordinance ( cap . 200 ) . it also seeks to regularize the procedures relating to the handling of persons arrested by members of the immigration service . i am grateful to the honourable miss emily lau and members of the bills committee for the great care they have taken in scrutinizing the bill and the valuable suggestions that they have put forward during the committee stage . this process has helped the administration considerably to fine - tune the bill to address possible concerns of the public with the additional powers to be conferred on the immigration service . the major committee stage amendments in respect of this bill which we propose will help to safeguard the rights of individuals being investigated or arrested : ( a ) first , in any case of detention taking place before formal arrest , we propose to provide for a maximum length of 12 hours ; ( b ) secondly , we propose to confine the total detention period between initial detention for inquiry and bringing an arrested person before a magistrate or release of the person to 48 hours ; and ( c ) thirdly , we propose to amend section 13 (1) and (2) by deleting the words " appearing to him to have control of the place or to be residing therein " and substituting " residing in or in charge of the place " . this is modelled on section 50 (3) of the police force ordinance ( cap . 232 ) and provides a better safeguard to private premises against search by members of the immigration service . we also propose a number of minor amendments to the bill to bring it more into line with other legislation governing the powers of other disciplined forces . i can assure honourable members that whilst the administration wishes to ensure that officers of the immigration service are given the necessary powers of investigation to discharge their statutory duties , it is equally concerned that there should be adequate checks and balances to prevent any abuse of powers . we are satisfied that the bill , with the committee stage amendments that we propose , now strikes a right balance , and that the existing stringent safeguards against any abuse of power are effective and sufficient . i would like to respond here to the issue which both miss emily lau and the honourable james to have shown concern about . we are already providing extensive training on investigation work and powers to investigators of the immigration service . once the bill is passed , new training courses and briefings will be put in place by the immigration department to ensure that staff of the immigration service who will be wielding the new powers are conversant with the law and capable of exercising the powers conferred on them . appropriate standing orders will be issued to guide and regulate the exercise of these proposed powers . in fact , most of the powers conferred by the bill are similar to existing powers exercised under the immigration ordinance . we are confident that officers of the immigration service will have no difficulties in assuming the new investigation responsibilities . in response to the request of the bills committee , the administration will submit a paper to the legislative council security panel detailing the complaints handling procedures and training provided to officers of the immigration service when the bill comes into operation . we shall definitely follow up with this pledge . mr president , i recommend the immigration service ( amendment ) bill 1996 to this council . question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1995 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 18 october 1995 mr ronald arculli : mr president , i rise to speak in my capacity as the chairman of the bills committee formed to study the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1995 . the said bill was introduced into this council at the first regular sitting of the current session on 18 october 1995 . the bills committee has taken one legislative council year to complete scrutiny of the bill . altogether the bills committee has held 19 meetings , paid one visit to a construction site and received over 300 written submissions . i shall highlight some of the major issues considered by the bills committee . the first part of the bill deals with the regulation of building professionals . members of the bills committee welcome the proposals under the bill to improve the existing registration system of authorized persons ( ap ) and registered structural engineers ( rse ) by bringing the criteria for registration in line with those under other building professional registration ordinances , namely , the architects registration ordinance , the engineers registration ordinance , and the surveyors registration ordinance . the only major query raised by members is the proposal to include a lay member in the ap registration committee and the rse registration committee . the administration had explained that the policy of including a lay member is intended to allow public views be reflected in each registration committee because the duties of these building professionals are closely related to public interest and judgement factors will be considered in dealing with registration matters . the bills committee , whilst accepting the administration 's explanations , considers the proposed nomination mechanism for lay members unsatisfactory . at the suggestion of members , the administration has agreed to improve the nomination system , the registration and the renewal procedures and the disciplinary proceedings for ap and rse . amongst these improvements , a major one is to empower the building authority ( ba ) to establish panels of members including lay persons for appointment to the ap registration committee and the rse registration committee , and to appoint more than one registration committee of each type at any one time . regarding the registration system for contractors , the bills committee supports the proposed new contractor registration system to replace the existing one with a view to upgrading the standards of building contractors . however , members share the concern of the trade that this objective should be pursued with regard to the practical situation . to enhance certainty as to the criteria for registration , the administration has worked jointly with the trade and come up with a set of criteria which will be specified in the bill . the administration has also assured members that a registered contractor will not be struck out from the list or be refused for retention of name because of absence or lack of physical works for a certain period . a contractor 's name will only be removed on the ground that it has ceased to engage in the building business . this assurance has allayed the trade 's concern on the matter . on the transitional arrangements , the administration has taken on board members ' suggestion to amend the bill to reflect that the registration of a contractor who is registered at the commencement of the new registration scheme will continue in force for two years . this arrangement will allow the existing contractors who have entered into building contracts before the enactment of the bill to honour their contractual obligations and fulfil the new requirements . mr president , the bills committee has spent considerable time examining the proposed requirement under the bill for the submission of a supervision plan by the ap to the ba for approval prior to the commencement of building or demolition works . the professional institutions have pointed out a number of deficiencies of such a proposal . to mention just a few ; a prescribed supervision plan is excessively rigid and will not accommodate changes if site circumstances so require . since the professionals are required to follow a prescribed plan , it will inhibit the exercise of professional judgement . moreover , at the design stage of a building project , it is practically impossible to prepare a detailed supervision plan outlining the level of supervision at each stage and the manpower necessary to carry out the required level of site supervision . the professional institutions have repeatedly stressed that ap and rse are design professionals and they are not in control of the day - to - day site operation the responsibility for which rests with the registered contractors . to overcome the shortcomings of a prescribed supervision plan but without compromising the standards of site supervision , the administration , modeled on a counter proposal proposed by the professional institutions , has put forth alternative proposals to address the concerns of members raised in the course of deliberation . under these alternative proposals , no consent to commence works shall be issued by the ba , unless a supervision plan for the works has been submitted . the ap shall submit an outline supervision plan , followed by a series of detailed supervision plans prepared by ap , rse or registered contractor at different stages of works . the professional responsibility will rest with the person who prepares the plans . both members of the bills committee and the professional institutions have agreed that the secretary for planning , environment and lands shall issue a technical memorandum which will set out the requirements , format and content of a supervision plan . i need to point out that the most controversial issue lies with the proposal to make it a criminal offence for failure to provide proper supervision of building works in the prescribed manner . whilst there is no doubt that everybody considers site safety important and agrees that appropriate measures should be taken to enhance safety , but it calls into question whether applying criminal sanction to persons in the building trade is the right way to do it . the building professionals have expressed strong sentiments on the matter . the bills committee has had thorough and in - depth discussion on the merits of criminal sanction . since my colleague , the honourable edward ho , will move a committee stage amendment on behalf of the bills committee to delete the provisions about criminal sanction , i shall leave this area to mr ho for elaboration . mr president , i wish to take this opportunity to thank the hong kong institute of architects , the hong kong institution of engineers , the hong kong institute of surveyors , the hong kong construction association and the real estate developers association of hong kong for the participation in the scrutiny of the bill . their invaluable contributions in terms of time , effort and suggestions have helped improve the bill in a much workable and practicable form . on behalf of the bills committee , i would also like to thank the administration for their hardwork and endeavour to co-operate with members , notwithstanding that it holds different views from those of the bills committee on the question of criminal sanction . mr president , subject to the amendments to be moved by the administration and the honourable edward ho , i commend the bill to members . mr edward ho : mr president , the building industry is in support of any measures to improve safety on sites . they support the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1995 which is part of a series of legislative measures to enhance safety . but they do not support in its totality because of the problems i shall deal with later in my speech . the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1995 can be roughly divided into three parts , and i shall deal briefly with these parts individually . registration of authorized persons ( aps ) and registered structural engineers ( rses ) the bill provides for revisions to the composition of the relevant registration committees for aps and rses to provide for more self-regulation by professionals nominated from the relevant registration boards . i fully support these proposals which have been worked out with the support of the professional institutions . registration of contractors i welcome the introduction of a system of registration for general building contractors which will take into account their qualifications , competence and experience . this will ensure that only contractors who possess the required level of competency will be allowed to carry out building works . the system will also allow the introduction of registers of specialist contractors to do more specialized types of construction works . this is also strongly supported . the proposed register of general building contractors only calls for one class of contractors for any scale and complexity of buildings . in other words , the qualification and experience of registered contractors will be determined by the lowest common denominators . i hope that the administration will give serious consideration to my proposal of a classification system whereby contractors will be qualified for different levels of scales of projects . it is important that only suitably qualified contractors are allowed to take on large scale building works , whilst not depriving the smaller contractors to work on smaller sized projects . supervision plans the bills committee has to meet 20 times , including the visit , on this bill , mainly because of the difficulties encountered with the concept of the introduction of supervision plans . the original bill was conceived as if the sole intention was to enable the administration to impose criminal sanctions on as many as possible of the parties involved , regardless of whether any or all of these parties have been responsible . i called that the " shot - gun " approach . one example was that the supervision plan was to be prepared collectively by the authorized person ( ap ) , the registered structural engineer ( rse ) and the contractor , despite the very different roles and responsibilities of the various parties involved in the building process . mr president , it is fortunate that due to the capable leadership of the honourable ronald arculli , the persistent and conscientious efforts of members of the bills committee , and if i might say also , the very pragmatic approach of the administration especially since the appointment of dr choy , and representatives from the concerned professional and trade organizations , a number of amendments will be proposed at the committee stage , which if supported by honourable members , will render the bill much fairer in the distribution of responsibilities , and much clearer for practising professionals and contractors to follow . insofar as supervision is concerned , let me explain that the professional 's role is quite different to that of the contractor . the former 's responsibility is one of periodic supervision to ensure that the contractor was in general compliance with the provisions of the contract and the relevant government regulations . he exercises his judgment as to the frequency of his inspections , and what part of the works should be inspected , much like the medical practitioner exercising his professional judgment on how frequent he needs to visit his patient . the professional 's role is also limited to that of the permanent works . the contractor , on the other hand , has the responsibility of continuous supervision , and to the safety of temporary works . he has also the responsibility of ensuring a safe working environment for the workers under the provisions of the factories and industrial undertakings ordinance . members of the bills committee have been unanimous in removing criminal sanctions due to deviation from the supervision plans . they have considered this question very carefully . they have considered it more appropriate to introduce disciplinary proceedings for professional negligence , which in the worst case will remove the professional from the register of ap or rse . in addition , they are aware that professionals are already burdened with very major civil and even criminal liabilities as a result of professional negligence . i shall elaborate on these and other relevant aspects when i move my amendment at the committee stage to remove the criminal sanctions . finally , i wish to make two further points here . the first is that the administration has agreed to issue a technical memorandum to deal with aspects of the supervision plans which will be subject to the vetting of this council . there should be different and earlier effective dates for other provisions of the bill so that such matters of registration of contractors can proceed as quickly as possible . the second issue is related to the issuance of cease work orders . these have very major economic impact on building projects . cease work orders should be withdrawn as soon as remedial action has been taken on non-compliance that has caused such an order . mr president , the bill , after going through all the amendments at the committee stage later on , will be a much better version than that before scrutiny by the bills committee . it will provide a sound framework for improving safety on site . with these remarks , i support the bill as amended later on . mr albert chan : mr president , the democratic party welcomes the proposed amendments to the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1995 . these amendments will bring obvious improvements to industrial safety . the areas involved in the bill are very complicated and complex technicalities are involved . under this bill , not only developers but also various professionals related to construction are affected . there will even be implications on construction workers , especially the foremen who will face more serious implications . the bills committee , after having discussed the government 's proposals , suggested a lot of amendments . the government has accepted most of our advice and will move consequential amendments at the committee stage later on . as the honourable ronald arculli , chairman of the bills committee , and the honourable edward ho have explained and commented on many aspects of the bill , i am not going to repeat those points . i would like to point out only one thing . for the whole piece of legislation , there is no satisfactory solution to or way of dealing with the part on criminal sanction to date . in principle , the democratic party supports criminal sanction for violation of safety requirements because this will give the legislation greater force and enhance its deterrent effect on those who fail to fully comply with industrial safety requirements . however , two problems have not been fully resolved or satisfactorily tackled . one of these problems is that the existing legislation is not applicable to government public works . the democratic party feels that according to the principle of " everybody is equal before the law " , it is hard to justify that when the same problems as occurred in private projects are found in public projects , the parties responsible for public projects can be exempted from penalty while their counterparts in private projects cannot . we think this is unacceptable because a lot of government public works are constructed by private contractors . under such a system , there is no reason why the government should be treated favourably and exempted from penalty . such a principle is acceptable in the spirit of the law . for the second problem , it seems that there have been less discussions about it . but in fact during the initial stage of the bill 's scrutiny , i already pointed out that the bill is not only aimed at professionals , who have actively expressed their opinions during the past 10 months . highlighting the fact that non-adherence to the supervision plan may lead to criminal prosecution , i have noted that construction site workers , especially the foremen are equally likely to face criminal charges . nonetheless , it is a pity that there have been neither extensive discussions on the possibility of criminal prosecution faced by construction workers , nor positive responses from the trade unions during the past few months . during this period , i asked some construction workers on different occasions , and most of them opposed the idea that they would be held criminally liable for failure to adhere to the supervision plan . as mr edward ho has just said , requirements regarding the contents of the supervision plan will be clearly set out in the technical memorandum to be issued . as regards the scope of implications on construction site workers , there is still part of it which remains unclear . so we consider it a premature step as well as a premature decision to include construction site workers in the list of people who will be subject to criminal sanction . the democratic party does not support the introduction of criminal sanction at the present stage on the grounds that it is unfair from a legal point of view and that discussion as well as consultation about its implications on the construction workers have been inadequate . so we will support mr ho 's amendments . but we have to make our stance clear to the government : the democratic party in principle thinks that criminal sanction is necessary . at the final meeting of the bills committee , the government explicitly said for the first time that in principle it does not oppose the imposition of criminal liability on parties responsible for public projects . given that the government does not oppose it , the democratic party considers that criminal sanction is an important part . we therefore strongly urge the government to speedily introduce a new amendment bill in the next session if mr ho 's amendment is carried ( which means that the provision regarding criminal sanction is negatived ) . in the new amendment bill , the part concerning criminal liability should be included and all public projects should be covered by the relevant provisions . if the government fails to propose such an amendment in the next session , the democratic party may present a member 's bill in order to include this part in the legislation and seek to deal with the implications on construction workers by initiating a comprehensive review and a new amendment bill . mr president , in my past five years as legislative council member , i have not taken part in as many bills committees as the honourable james to has . this bill concerning the safety of construction is rather complicated and has taken a lot of our time in discussions . but it is a pity that only a small number of members took part in the bills committee . after 20 meetings , members of the bills committee reached a unanimous opinion about the amendments . i hope members can support the amendments proposed and agreed by the bills committee . thank you , mr president . mr cheng yiu - tong : mr president , the hong kong federation of trade unions ( ftu ) and myself have always been very concerned about promoting the prevention of industrial accidents . as regards the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill , which seeks to make site professionals including architects and engineers criminally liable for industrial accidents , the ftu and i are ready to give our full support . mr president , it is extremely crucial for the bill to require the professionals to be criminally liable . in fact , the court has tremendous difficulty in imposing criminal sanction on these professionals unless it can be proved that the industrial accidents are caused by their wilful negligence leading to death or injury , otherwise it is impossible to impose heavy penalty on them . in view of the above , the ftu and i feel that if the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill cannot make the building professionals criminally liable , it will be nothing but a " toothless tiger " or " a facade with no substance " and that is useless in the prevention of industrial accidents . the ftu opines that as professionals of the above - mentioned projects , it is their professional ethics to shoulder some inescapable responsibilities in the prevention of industrial accidents . in chapter 9 of the international labour convention , which is about construction safety and health , it is stated that people who are responsible for building works design and requirements have to take into account the safety and health of building workers according to national laws , regulations and practices . the british government also put the construction ( design and management ) regulations into effect on 31 march 1995 . the consultation paper on the review of industrial safety in hong kong published by the education and manpower branch last year also made the same recommendations . mr president , since the workers , employers and governments in the international arena have all agreed on the proposal concerned , and it is also written into the international labour convention , the ftu and i very much hope that the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill moved by the government in this council can be passed as soon as possible . some members have indicated that they will not support the government 's proposal simply because the original bill proposed by the government does not include those building professionals working on government sites and hence they do not have to be criminally liable for any industrial accident . they therefore oppose the government 's bill and support the honourable edward ho 's amendment . if members refuse to support the original bill and so it cannot be enacted simply because it does not include those professionals working on government sites , the professionals working on private sites will then be able to evade their responsibility and so industrial safety will not be improved , this would be something improper . actually , we can first support the original bill proposed by the government , and then continue to fight for our ultimate goal after its enactment so that it is extended to cover government sites . this is what we should do in promoting industrial safety . the ftu and myself will continue to strive for opportunities of improvement in this direction after the enactment of this bill . mr president , these are my remarks . mr ip kwok - him : mr president , as our community ages , there will be more and more demolition and construction works going on for redevelopment . it is believed that the collapse of an external wall and the falling of a concrete pillar during demolition works in nathan road and kennedy town respectively in 1994 have prompted the government to pay more attention to the improvement of safety at construction and demolition sites and complete the review concerned . and this is why the bill is presented to this council for examination today . the bill proposes to improve the registration system of building professionals , and also tighten the safety control over building works and sites with work in progress . this spirit is worth our support and it is also going in the right direction . however , it is most regrettable that the government has also introduced a provision in this bill to impose criminal sanction on people failing to ensure safety at construction sites . the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong ( dab ) does not agree with this proposal . there are already provisions with criminal sanction in the existing legislation to deal with contractors or engineers who pay little attention to site safety in such a manner as to cause accidents involving death or injury . under the existing buildings ordinance , it is already stipulated that if those people responsible for construction sites , including developers and the professionals concerned , violate the law , such as condoning jerry - building or fraudulent behaviour , withholding information or failing to carry out regular site inspection , they will be held criminally liable . nevertheless , the present proposal of the government requires the professionals concerned to be held criminally liable immediately , and that means the prosecution does not need to prove the professionals ' motives and reasons for breaching the law . this is unfair to the people in the industry . secondly , the government has created a double standard in this bill . criminal sanction is only applicable to those building professionals in the private sector . for construction or demolition sites under the responsibility of government departments and those professionals employed by government , if any problem occurs , the public officers �0�0 who are actually responsible for half of all the construction projects in hong kong �0�0 can be exempted from criminal sanction . this is extremely unfair because this is " one law , two systems " , and it also violates the spirit of the rule of law in which " all men are equal before the law " . in addition , the bill also states that all the parties at construction sites , including registered engineers , owners , contractors and also workers working there , have to follow the specified works procedures . criminal sanction will be imposed if there is any violation . however , the crux of the problem is that the authorized persons and registered engineers are not in control of the day - to - day operations at construction sites . to hold them criminally liable for any violation of the supervision plan is to give them a duty that they cannot perform . mr president , the dab believes criminal sanction may not be able to ensure site safety , and the key problem is that contractors and workers do not have a proper idea about industrial safety and there is inadequate training for them . the government has to step up its work in this area . the dab supports the amendment of the honourable edward ho . these are my remarks . secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr president , i would like to thank the honourable ronald arculli , chairman of the bills committee , and other members for their very careful and detailed deliberation on this bill in the past nine months . this bill serves two main purposes . the first aims to strengthen supervision and safety management at construction and demolition sites through the introduction of a supervision plan system . the second is to improve the registration system for authorized persons , registered structural engineers and building contractors . the bills committee and other concerned parties , such as the relevant professional bodies and the contractors associations and real estate developers association , have given many valuable comments on specific provisions of the bill . the administration agrees with most of these comments , and i shall move the necessary amendments to the bill at the committee stage later on . however , it may be useful if i could explain in some detail the administration 's response to a number of points raised by the bills committee and other organizations . with regard to the registration of authorized persons and structural engineers , there will be panels of members from whom the building authority may appoint more than one registration committee . the building authority will be empowered to direct the registration committee to hold meetings in order to help ensure that the applications for registration as authorized persons and structural engineers will be processed expeditiously . the registration will continue to be in force while an application for renewal is still being processed , subject to any order of the disciplinary board . this is to obviate the administrative problem of processing a large number of applications within a fixed time limit . i also wish to assure the honourable edward ho that his suggestion of a classification system for contractors will be seriously considered . the building authority will be required to give reasons why an application for inclusion , retention or restoration of name in the relevant register is rejected . he will also be required to inform an authorized person or registered structural engineer before removing the latter 's name from the relevant register . furthermore , a legal adviser will be appointed to assist in the proceedings of the disciplinary board for authorized persons and registered structural engineers . the power of a judge to dismiss an appeal against a decision of the board if he considered that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice , even if he was of the opinion that the point raised in the appeal might have been decided in favour of the appellant , will be removed . these measures will serve to further improve the fairness of the disciplinary proceedings . similar amendments will be moved by me to other provisions of the bill relating to the registration of general building contractors and specialist contractors . moreover , the factors which will be taken into account in considering whether an applicant qualifies to register as a contractor will be clearly set out . in the case of general building contractors , the building authority will be allowed to accept relevant local experience as a substitute for the required qualifications . as a transition arrangement , the registration of existing contractors will continue to be in force for two years after the commencement of the relevant provisions of the bill . to implement the supervision plan system , the building authority may refuse to give his consent to the commencement of works where the authorized person has failed to lodge a supervision plan . the format and content of the plan have to comply with the requirements set out in the technical memorandum which will be formulated by the building authority in consultation with the professional institutes and the construction industry , and approved by this council under the negative vetting procedures . to ensure that supervision plans are complied with , we will recommend a three - tier sanction system . minor deviations from the supervision plan may entail administrative warnings given by the building authority . material deviations or repeated minor deviations will be made a disciplinary offence . material deviations which directly result in injury to persons or damage to property or a risk of injury or damage will be made a criminal offence . however , provisions will be made for exceptional circumstances when urgent action is required for safety reasons to permit deviations from the supervision plan . the building authority will be empowered to order works to cease when the conditions of approval or consent given by him has not been or is not able to be complied with , or when there is material deviation from the technical memorandum or the supervision plan , which may lead to dangerous or potentially dangerous situations . i am , like the honourable ronald arculli , pleased to note that the bills committee has indicated support for all but one of the amendments to be moved by me , that is , criminal sanction provision when material deviations from the supervision plan directly result in injury to persons or damage to property or a risk of injury or damage . i will further explain the views of the administration and clarify any misunderstandings like those expressed by the honourable albert chan and the honourable ip kwok - him about government architects and engineers not subject to criminal sanctions on the issue during the committee stage . thank you , mr president . question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . buildings ( amendment ) bill 1996 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 14 february 1996 mr albert chan : mr president , i would like to report to members the deliberations of the bills committee on the buildings ( amendment ) bill 1996 , of which i am the chairman . the bills committee was formed on 16 february 1996 and has held two meetings with the administration . as explained by the secretary for planning , environment and lands at the second reading of the bill , one of the objectives of the bill is to empower the building authority to require owners of buildings to conduct an investigation of drains and sewers that affect slope safety . the bills committee was concerned that owners of buildings may be required by the building authority to undertake unnecessary slope investigation works . to prevent any possible abuse of power by the building authority , members considered it necessary to specify the circumstances under which an order can be served by the building authority . taking on board members ' suggestion , the administration has agreed to amend the bill to the effect that the criteria for deciding whether an order should be served include the likelihood of leakage , defect or inadequacy of the drains , sewers and water pipes of the buildings concerned . also at members ' suggestion , the administration has agreed that water pipes should be covered in the bill . accordingly , a definition of " water pipe " is added and the power of the building authority to require an investigation by property owners will be extended to cover water pipes that affect slope safety . another area of concern of the bills committee , mr president , is the delineation of responsibility to undertake slope stabilizing works as a result of leaking drains or sewers laid in slopes situated on crown land or government land . the administration has pointed out that owners of private buildings are responsible for the maintenance and repairs of drains serving their buildings , regardless of their location . however , they will not be required to bear the extra costs of upgrading the public slopes to meet improved standards , because such responsibility clearly rests with the government . to put it beyond doubt that owners of private buildings whose drains or sewers laid in unleased land will not be exempted from the responsibility of undertaking repair works , the administration will move a committee stage amendment to the bill to clarify this point . the bills committee has noted that the building authority will generally carry out investigation works on behalf of the owners of private buildings in an emergency situation , or in cases where the order issued is not complied with or upon the owners ' request . subject to the registration of the relevant orders with the land registry , the costs of works will be recovered from the owners of the buildings at the completion of the investigation works . in case the owners are unwilling to pay after the completion of the works , the outstanding costs will be registered in the land registry as a debt owed to the government . mr president , the administration has assured members that the enacted bill will enhance slope safety by giving the building authority more powers to order the investigation of drains , sewers and water pipes that affect slope safety . the amendment relating to cost recovery will make it easier for the building authority to recover the costs of works . at the same time , it will also protect the interest of prospective property buyers as they will be aware of the potential liability before they proceed with the purchase . members are satisfied that the committee stage amendments to be moved by the administration will address the concerns raised by the bills committee . lastly , i would like to extend my appreciation on behalf of the bills committee to the administration and especially to the representatives of the legal department who are responsible for drafting the provisions for their contribution to the expeditious scrutiny of the bill . mr president , subject to the amendments moved by the administration , i recommend the bill to members . thank you , mr president . the president ' s deputy , mr ronald arculli , took the chair . secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr deputy , i would like to thank the honourable albert chan , chairman of the bills committee , and other members for supporting this bill and the committee stage amendment that i will propose . this bill has three purposes : empowering the building authority to order owners to carry out investigations into drains and sewers for slope safety reasons ; facilitating the recovery of the cost of works carried out by the building authority on behalf of building owners ; and making clear that a closure order will cease to have effect when the concerned structures are demolished or cease to exist . in scrutinizing the bill , some members proposed that water pipes should also be covered by the bill . we agree , and have prepared committee stage amendments to this effect . upon the enactment of the bill , the buildings department will maintain close liaison with the water supplies department in exercising the new power to require investigations into water pipes and remedial works regarding any leakage , defect or inadequacy identified . members have also expressed concern over the discretion of the building authority in serving orders requiring investigations into water pipes , drains and sewers . we have prepared committee stage amendments to provide that , where the building authority is of the opinion that no leakage , defect or inadequacy is likely , no order shall be served . in forming his opinion , the building authority should take into account all relevant matters and information such as the age of the water pipes , drains or sewers and records of previous investigations and maintenance works . the building authority 's decision is also subject to appeal to the appeal tribunal under part vi of the buildings ordinance , the members of which are mainly independent legal or building professionals . we believe this provides the necessary safeguard against potential abuse of power . we have also prepared a committee stage amendment to ensure that an owner is responsible for the maintenance of and investigations into the water pipes , drains and sewers serving his building irrespective of where such pipes , drains and sewers are laid . thank you , mr deputy . question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . inland revenue ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1996 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 1 may 1996 mr eric li : mr deputy , i speak to applaud the introduction of this bill which is part of the 1996-97 budget proposals . the objective of the amendment bill is to exempt from profits tax liability in respect of non-residents ' investment activities through stock brokers and fund managers in hong kong . as the legislative council representative for accountants in hong kong , i recognize with appreciation that this bill represents a positive response to one of our specific budget recommendations . in the course of my examination of this bill , i have received many representations from my constituency members acting on behalf of the stock exchange and other eminent professional bodies . the main complaints were technical in nature and have focused on the narrowness of the assistance offered by the exemption in its draft form . in particular , section 20aa of the bill , which seeks to add certainty to the tax liability of brokers and approved investment advisors acting as agents for non-resident investors , seemed to have worked quite the other way . the accountancy profession submits that the exclusion of associates , a vague term introduced in this new section , from the exemption is unnecessarily restrictive . we consider that all restrictions on local brokers should be removed so that they can freely carry on their business and hence further enhance the development of hong kong securities in the international market . this , we believe , to be the true spirit of the financial secretary 's original budget proposal . however , since this is the last sitting of the legislative council before the long summer break and any amendment at a late stage of the bill 's scrutiny may cause substantial delay and hence the implementation of other provisions in the bill which are of equal importance to the securities industry , we therefore accept with some reluctance the amendment bill in its present form together with the administration 's assurances of giving advance rulings and the issue of clear departmental interpretation and practice notes by the commissioner of the inland revenue on matters in the various correspondences between myself , the administration and the professional bodies concerned , which now form part of the record of the house committee . nevertheless , i would still request the administration to consider appropriate amendments to section 20aa and section 20aa (1) ( a ) at the earliest or subsequent opportunity in order to remove any remaining doubts in the implementation of this valuable exemption . i would also like to record my personal appreciation of the professionalism , responsiveness and efficiency in the way in which the administration has handled this bill . it was our mutual willingness to get on with business which has helped me to sort out this rather complex and technical bill with the administration expeditiously and without the need to set up yet another bills committee , and also in the spirit of mutual trust and co-operation . i am convinced that , given the circumstances , the timely balance struck will best serve the financial services industry of hong kong . with these remarks , mr deputy , i support the bill and urge honourable colleagues to do likewise . secretary for the treasury : mr deputy , i am grateful for members ' support for the resumption of the second reading debate of the bill . the bill has two objectives . first , it seeks to reflect existing practices and provide greater certainty in law by : ( a ) excluding stock brokers and investment advisers from potential profits tax liability in respect of share trading and fund investment profits derived by non-resident investors for whom they act as agents ; and ( b ) including a specific tax exemption for certain income derived from bona fide offshore funds managed in hong kong . secondly , the bill seeks to extend the current tax exemption for stock borrowing and lending transactions to cover also stocks not listed in hong kong . this is in response to a request made by the financial services sector for promoting stock borrowing and lending transactions in hong kong . after the publication of the bill , we have received submissions from the law society of hong kong , the hong kong society of accountants , the joint liaison committee on taxation , the taxation institute of hong kong and the stock exchange of hong kong . we are grateful for their views on the bill . i would also like to thank in particular the valuable advice on the bill given to us by the honourable eric li . we have carefully examined these views and , as a result , i will move at committee stage a number of amendments . i shall explain at that stage the reasons for the amendments ; but i would like to take this opportunity to address two points concerning the legislative intent of the bill in respect of the first objective which i have just described . section 20aa as proposed in the bill seeks to exclude brokers and investment advisers from potential profits tax liability for acting as agents for non-resident investors . we note the concern expressed by various parties in respect of the restriction imposed under the bill that the provisions in section 20aa would not apply in cases where the investors and the agents have an " associate " relationship . we have thoroughly examined this issue and remain of the view that the imposition of the restriction is justified and necessary . in such cases , the agent , being the associate of his client , should be able to ascertain whether there is any potential liability to profits tax and the question of uncertainty which we aim to address in the bill by providing the tax exemption therefore should not arise . there is a limit to how far the tax exemption provided under the proposed legislation should go without creating opportunities for tax avoidance . we believe that we have struck the right balance in the bill . our proposal does not imply that the parties concerned under an " associate " relationship would automatically be chargeable to profits tax . this is by no means the case . whether a tax liability arises will depend on the circumstances of each case and on the application of the existing provisions of the inland revenue ordinance . the situation for these cases with " associate " relationship will not be inferior to what it is now , before the proposed legislation is enacted . there is also no question of the proposed legislation preventing a non-resident investor from , or placing any restriction on him in , making use of an associated agent in hong kong . however , to reflect better our legislative intent , the commissioner of inland revenue will issue a practice note to clarify issues relating to the application of the " associate " restriction and the interpretation of the term " non-resident " as requested by the various parties concerned . we also note the concern of various parties that section 20ab as proposed in the bill , which is modelled on legislation in the united kingdom and sought to provide a specific tax exemption for certain income derived from bona fide offshore funds managed in hong kong , is not easy to follow . instead of achieving its objective , it may on the contrary complicate the existing tax system in this area . we have reviewed the approach and concluded that a simpler way to achieve the policy objective and to reflect our legislative intent is to amend existing section 26a ( 1a ) of the inland revenue ordinance to extend the present tax exemption under the section to cover also mutual fund corporations and unit trusts established outside hong kong or similar collective investment schemes , provided that the commissioner of inland revenue is satisfied that the mutual fund corporation , unit trust or collective investment scheme is a bona fide widely held investment vehicle which complies with the requirements of a supervisory authority within an acceptable regulatory regime . we are pleased to note that this revised approach is welcomed by the various parties concerned . i will move amendments at committee stage to delete the proposed section 20ab and replace it with a new clause to this effect . no prior approval from the commissioner is necessary for an individual investment vehicle to qualify for the proposed tax exemption under section 26a ( 1a ) provided that the requirements as stipulated in this bill are satisfied . the commissioner is prepared to give advance ruling if there is doubt in individual cases . the commissioner will also issue a practice note to clarify the interpretation of such terms as " supervisory body " and " acceptable regulatory regime " under the bill . thank you , mr deputy . question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . supplementary appropriation ( 1995-96 ) bill 1996 resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 26 june 1996 question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . committee stage of bills council went into committee . prevention of bribery ( miscellaneous provisions ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1995 the president resumed the chair . clauses 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 11 to 14 and 18 mr james to : mr chairman , it is proposed in clause 2 of the bill that the term " crown servant " be included in the definition of " public servant " , as a way to deal with the problem of some special categories such as judges , so that they will fall within the ambit of the prevention of bribery ordinance . mr chairman , i would like to urge the government to consider two points . firstly , as there has recently been a series of incidents involving acceptance of benefits by councillors , i hope the government can take this opportunity to review whether councillors should be included in the definition of " crown servant " or " public servant " in the prevention of bribery ordinance . at present , civil servants are required to observe absolute codes of conduct . they will be prosecuted for receiving any benefits , even though it cannot be proved that these benefits are obtained in connection with their official capacities . i hope the government will conduct a review to see whether this criterion can also be applied to councillors at all levels . for the time being , i have not formed my own views . but on the basis of public debates recently , i hope the government can conduct a review on this matter . on the other hand , clause 3 of the bill concerning section 10 (2) of the ordinance is a deeming provision . i accept that this amendment is consequential upon the requirement for changes under the hong kong bill of rights ordinance . but recently we see in the attorney general v holgate case that this deeming provision may still cause injustice and the court of appeal has made a ruling on this point . the root of the whole contention is that in considering whether the defendant has violated section 10 (1) , the property of a third party will be included as the assets of the defendant under this deeming provision . however , the defendant has no investigation power . neither is he empowered to inquire into the property owned by the third party . in the bills committee , i have suggested that if the prosecution must deem a third party 's property as the defendant 's assets , it should at least , upon the request of the defendant , try its best to find the third party and bring him / her to court for cross - examination in the witness box . this would be a fairer deal for the defendant . meanwhile , the bills committee has also discussed whether the defendant should be empowered to summon the third party concerned for cross - examination prior to the trial so that he could obtain more information beforehand for use in his defence . the government initially agreed to this suggestion , but rejected it after consideration on the grounds that this would set a precedent in criminal proceedings . however , in any case , i hope the government can consider that whenever such a prosecution is made , the independent commission against corruption would provide all possible assistance in the form of human and other resources to help the defendant find the third party should such a need arise . clauses 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 11 to 14 and 18 were agreed to . clauses 1 , 4 to 7 , 10 , 15 , 16 and 17 attorney general : mr chairman , for the reasons given earlier today in the debate on this bill , i move that clauses 1 , 4 to 7 , 10 , 15 , 16 and 17 be amended as set out under my name in the paper circulated to members . proposed amendments clause 1

, regarding clause 1 of the bill , under the major premise that the attorney general has undertaken to bring all the provisions into effect as soon as possible , the bills committee recommends this amendment to members . mr chairman , on the other hand , as regards the effective date , i personally hope that the attorney general can implement this law as soon as possible . the attorney general has just raised his arguments in the second reading debate , but i have some misgivings . it is because the scrutiny of the bill has already taken more than 15 months from mid - 1995 up to the present . in the course of this , the icac has done some preparatory work in many aspects . it was in fact stated in the icac 's 1995 annual report that preparatory work had been done . furthermore , in october 1995 , the commissioner of the icac , following the governor 's policy address , revealed that he had made the necessary preparations for this legislation in his policy briefing for the coming year for members . in my opinion , the only preparatory work that is needed is that the court will have to lay down some court rules and the icac may have to formulate some internal guidelines in order to cope with the implementation of the new legislation . however , at any rate , i hope the attorney general can put this legislation into effect as soon as possible and within the next three months . as regards clause 4 , the bills committee recommends it to members . the attorney general has just discussed about the amendment . i also have some views . although the government has made a concession in section 13 of the prevention of bribery ordinance , i think , as a matter of principle , all the powers of the commissioner should be exercised with the leave of the court . but what we have now is only a compromise . i urge the government to conduct a review in the future to see whether the only power in which the commissioner has sole discretion should also be subjected to the independent supervision of the court . as regards clause 5 , the bills committee also recommends the committee stage amendment to members . i am not going to repeat what have been said . but i would like to point out that this clause is concerned with tax records . the main justification is only investigation into cases of corruption involving the inland revenue department or its officers . as regards corruption cases outside this scope , i think the justification is insufficient and it will weaken the protection of tax secrecy . another important point is that tax information is often the result of some compromises between the taxpayers and the inland revenue department . if these tax records are submitted to the court as evidence , it may cause grave injustice to a trial . as regards clauses 6 ( a ) and 6 ( b ) , the bills committee recommends the government 's amendment to members . as regards clause 7 , the bills committee understands that this proposed amendment will not bring about other policy implications . so we also recommend this amendment to members . as regards clause 10 , the bills committee is of the opinion that the criteria as set down in the new clause 17 ( 1a ) " it appears to the court " and the criteria as set down in the new clause 17 ( 1b ) " it appears to the commissioner " should both be on a par with section 14 and substituted by " the court is satisfied " . so the bills committee supports the amendment proposed by the government in this aspect . my personal view is that as the commissioner of the icac still retains a power to issue a warrant without having to go through the court in an emergency situation , i urge the government to do three things . first , it should draw up internal guidelines to specify what should constitute an emergency situation where the commissioner can issue a search warrant without application to the court . secondly , i hope the government can undertake to report regularly to the operation review committee how many cases are deemed an emergency situation and a search warrant is issued by the commissioner without application to the court . thirdly , i hope that each year the annual report of the icac will state the number of warrants issued by the commissioner without application to the court so as to keep the public informed . mr chairman , as regards clause 15 , the bills committee would also like to recommend the government 's amendment to members . mr eric li : mr chairman , the accountancy profession has shown serious concern in recent months on the gradual weakening of the protection of tax secrecy provided by section 4 of the inland revenue ordinance . in this context , i am most grateful for the very understanding remarks made by the attorney general in the bill 's second reading debate . despite these serious concerns in safeguarding the interests of taxpayers , the accountancy profession , as a responsible public body , also recognizes the very high priority that this community as a whole accords to the combat of corruption . we also accept that there may be a need to have access to confidential tax records in the most exceptional circumstances . i understand from the commissioner of the icac during the bills committee 's meeting held on 12 june 1995 that there should only be two or three such cases in a year , and hence there is no question ...... chairman : mr li , which clause are you referring to ? which clause are you speaking on ? mr eric li : it is on section 13c but i believe it is clause 5 , but because of the ...... clause 5 . chairman : clause 5 ? mr eric li : clause 5 , yes . so i am correct . chairman : please continue . mr eric li : i just referred to the meeting held on 12 june 1995 and that there is no question of icac officers using the provision to launch a fishing expedition for evidence . the present committee stage amendment does effectively protect the identity of innocent taxpayers and third parties from being specifically disclosed . however , i have expressed some reservation during the bills committee 's examination that this may not have gone far enough . ideally , i would have liked to widen the committee stage amendment to ensure that all the circumstantial information which may lead to the revelation of the identity of the persons involved be also brought within the scope of the court application . this is particularly relevant if the persons concerned are well - known public figures and that the detailed events of the corruption case has already been well - publicized . nonetheless , in appreciation of the immense goodwill displayed by the administration and members of the bills committee in reaching a difficult consensus , i am content to give the present committee stage amendment a chance to prove its worth . nonetheless , i would still urge the administration to monitor its actual application carefully and to consider further appropriate amendments at the first sign of detecting any inadequacy . with these remarks , mr chairman , i thank the administration for taking over the committee stage amendment and urge honourable colleagues to join me in support of these committee stage amendments . mr james to : mr chairman , i am sorry i forgot to speak on clause 17 of the bill just now . chairman : you may not repeat yourself . mr james to : no , i will not mention the previous parts . it is just because i have omitted clause 17 . mr chairman , in response to the proposal made by the bills committee , the government has put forward an amendment to clause 17 of the bill , that is , to section 13 of the independent commission against corruption ordinance . the bills committee therefore hopes that members will support this amendment by the government . mr chairman , in respect of this clause , i have this to say . first , i am basically against a concept whereby the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) is empowered to gain access to information just for the purpose of advising public bodies to improve their prevention of corruption , that is , to assist them to improve on the incidence of corrupt practices . however , there is no corresponding power in the legislation to compel these public bodies to make improvement . in my opinion , for coercive powers to be not properly co-ordinated , it is logically inconsistent . and i think coercive powers should only be applied to case investigation or complaints against real crimes rather than compelling public bodies to improve their practices in the name of providing assistance . nevertheless , i agree that this amendment by the government has relieved me of some of my worries , because it somehow restricts the scope of information to be accessed to operational practices . finally , i am still concerned about the possible abuse of power . if the corruption prevention department , as a branch of the icac , could have such extensive powers , it may in effect be collecting information about corruption in general in the name of corruption prevention . at any rate , however , i support the government and hope it will closely monitor the situation and so will the icac to stem any of such possibilities . attorney general : thank you , mr chairman . if i can just respond very briefly to some of the points that have been made by the honourable james to and the honourable eric li . if i can just deal with mr james to 's point on clause 1 . let me restate , mr chairman , that i undertake to bring all the provisions of this bill when enacted into effect as soon as practicable . as i noted in my speech on the resumption of the second reading debate , there will have to be some lead time , for example , where provisions require court applications to be made , but we are as conscious as the honourable james to and other members of this council that , having spent so much time in anxious deliberation in the bills committee , it is in the public interest that the enacted bill be converted into effective law as soon as possible . that is as much our wish as it is the wish of members of this council . i have noted carefully the honourable james to 's points concerning clause 4 , and my remarks here will extend to other points on this bill . we will have to see how these provisions work in practice . we are changing the law , introducing court control for the first time in relation to the icac 's powers . we will obviously want to see how those powers work and to consider them in the light of experience . that applies particularly , i would suggest , mr chairman , in relation to clause 5 which concerns tax records , on which , as i say , the honourable james to and the honourable eric li expressed concerns . these are new powers . clearly a balance has to be struck . we do not want the icac hampered in their task of fighting corruption . we recognize fully concerns over the secrecy of taxpayers ' records . once again , we will want to keep these provisions under scrutiny and to monitor their operation , to monitor how the courts are applying them , to see whether in the light of experience further changes should be made . i have also noted carefully the honourable james to 's points concerning clause 10 of the bill . that deals with powers of search under section 17 of the prevention of bribery ordinance , and those are matters that i will , if i may , refer to the commissioner of the independent commission against corruption for his further consideration . finally , mr chairman , i note once again what the honourable james to said about clause 17 of the bill in relation to section 13 (2) of the icac ordinance . that section has as its scope the highly laudable objective of corruption prevention . i think that we should not be seeking to inhibit , and i know that is not the intention , the icac in that most laudable of aims . but i have once again heard the concerns expressed and i am sure the icac will take those to heart . thank you , mr chairman . question on the amendments proposed , put and agreed to . question on clauses 1 , 4 to 7 , 10 , 15 , 16 and 17 , as amended , put

" . question on the addition of the new clauses proposed , put and agreed to . new clause 13a offence to disclose identity , etc. of persons being investigated clause read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to standing order 46 (6) . chairman : the attorney general , mrs selina chow and mr albert ho have separately given notices to propose the addition of new clause 13a to the bill . i will first call upon the attorney general to speak and move the second reading of his proposed new clause 13a , as he is the public officer in charge of the bill . attorney general : mr chairman , i move that new clause 13a as set out under my name in the paper circulated to members be read the second time . the new clause repeals and replaces section 30 subsection (1) of the prevention of bribery ordinance . section 30 makes it an offence for a person , without lawful authority or reasonable excuse , to disclose details of an investigation in respect of an offence alleged or suspected to have been committed under the ordinance . this section has been a key element in the overall scheme for tackling corruption in hong kong . in the recent ming pao case , the privy council stated that the restrictions on freedom of expression created by section 30 are consistent with the bill of rights ordinance . the privy council said in that case : " it cannot be denied that there is a pressing social need to stamp out the evil of corruption in hong kong . investigation by the icac is an important means of achieving that end and the protection of the integrity of such investigation is essential . " the privy council also accepted that the section affords protection to the reputation of suspects , although it considered that this protection is of secondary importance to the protection of the integrity of the investigation . the fact that section 30 is consistent with the bill of rights ordinance does not mean that this council cannot decide , as a matter of policy , to amend the section . the question , therefore , is whether section 30 should be amended and , if so , in what way . the administration 's proposals the report of the icac review committee concluded that " no changes should be made to section 30 , which strikes the right balance between the need to protect the reputation of an individual under investigation and the secrecy of an investigation at the covert stage on the one hand , and the freedom of expression on the other . " the bill does not therefore include any provision to amend section 30 . some members of the bills committee nevertheless considered that there should be some relaxation of the restrictions in the section . the administration has listened carefully to those views and has agreed that subsection (1) of section 30 should be amended as follows : firstly , the offence will be expressly limited to disclosures made by a person who knows or suspects that an icac investigation is taking place ; and secondly , it will only apply to disclosures relating to an investigation into an offence under part ii of the ordinance ; the proposed new clause 13a will achieve this . i will shortly be moving the addition of a new clause 13b which will further limit the scope of section 30 . as well as proposing these relaxations to the section , the administration strongly believes that a recently discovered loophole in section 30 must be plugged . the privy council decided in the ming pao case that section 30 applies only to an investigation in respect of a specified person . disclosure of the details of a general investigation , as occurred in that case , is not an offence . mr chairman , the privy council came to its decision as a matter of statutory interpretation . it did not express any view as to whether there is any justification for distinguishing between the two types of investigation . the administration strongly believes that there is no justification for such a distinction . a general investigation needs to remain covert , and is equally vulnerable to being prejudiced by a disclosure as one in respect of an identified suspect . it is undeniable that an investigation may be prejudiced by a disclosure even though no particular suspect has been identified . for example , an investigation may relate to a small group of people , one of whom is in fact a corrupt person . a disclosure of details of that investigation may be as damaging as one which relates to an investigation into that person . the corrupt person may destroy all evidence of his corruption or may disappear . icac investigations need to be kept confidential , particularly at the early and particularly vulnerable stages of the investigation . if details of the early stages of an investigation can be freely disclosed , simply because there is no identified suspect , the investigation may never get to the stage where there is an identified suspect . all evidence of the crime may have been destroyed as a result of the disclosure . i will shortly be proposing amendments that relax the restrictions on disclosure at the more mature stages of the investigation , when there is less need for secrecy . but i urge members to support the amendment i propose to section 30 (1) which will ensure that the most vulnerable stage of an investigation is properly protected . question on the attorney general 's motion on second reading of the clause proposed . chairman : as mrs selina chow and mr albert ho have also given notices to propose the addition of new clause 13a to the bill , i propose to have the attorney general 's motion and the respective proposals by mrs selina chow and mr albert ho debated together in a joint debate . committee shall debate the attorney general 's motion and the respective proposals by mrs selina chow and mr albert ho together in a joint debate . i will call upon mrs selina chow to speak first on the attorney general 's motion as well as her own proposal and mr albert ho 's proposal . after mrs chow has spoken , i will call upon mr albert ho�0�0 to speak on the attorney general 's motion and mrs selina chow 's proposal as well as his own proposal . however , no motion on the second reading of either mrs selina chow 's proposal or mr albert ho 's proposal is to be moved at this stage . mrs selina chow : mr chairman , i do not wish to repeat what i said during the second reading debate of this bill except to urge members to vote for my amendment . the administration 's amendment does not just plug a loophole as the attorney general just put it , but aims to widen the scope of the present law to restrict disclosure on general investigation , and therefore is contrary to the general direction of liberalization , while mr ho 's amendment introducing the " likely to prejudice " test would in fact render the necessary restriction ineffective . i commend to members my amendment which strikes the right balance between the public 's right to know and freedom of expression on the one hand , and the protection of the integrity of investigations with identified suspects and the protection of reputation on the other . mr albert ho : mr chairman , when the democratic party considered whether section 30 should be preserved or amended , the first question that we asked ourselves was : is it necessary to preserve section 30 in our laws ? as a matter of fact , we did ask the government to show us some related provisions in other countries practising common law . we found that such provisions similar to section 30 in seeking to restrict the media from disclosing government investigation on certain people are either non-existent , or very rare . therefore , we really doubt whether hong kong needs this provision . of course , the bills committee and the democratic party finally agreed to put up with this provision mainly because of two reasons . first , we think that there are reasons to believe that investigation into corruption is a very difficult task . this will be even more difficult in the future , especially after 1997 . we hope that by taking into consideration the future investigation of the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) , we can give them a little protection which they think necessary . this kind of protection is purely to cater for the psychological needs of icac officers as well as to boost their morale . secondly , what is more important is that during the committee 's deliberation of the bill , the administration has made , in our opinion , a lot of rather good concessions . for instance , they are willing to grant a lot of statutory reasons for defence to the accused . these include some reasonable grounds for disclosure ; that the media and a third party can disclose any unlawful activity , abuse of power , negligence and the like on the part of the icac ; and they can also disclose information in the interests of the public , for example , when such disclosure helps our public security , public order , public health and public safety . the administration has also agreed that when an investigation reaches a mature stage , those provisions restricting disclosure should cease to apply . mr chairman , at present , it is the first part of the provision , to which i move my amendment , that evokes the greatest controversy . it contains two most controversial points . first , as the attorney general has just mentioned , after the privy council decision , they have discovered that there is a loophole because the law is not what they originally interpreted . they would now like to amend the law so that section 30 can be applied even when a subject of investigation has not yet been identified . in other words , section 30 will apply once a so - called general investigation has started . as honourable members know , according to the interpretation of the original provision by the privy council , a subject of investigation must be specified before section 30 can apply . mr chairman , as a matter of fact , it is very difficult to understand that there can be a case where there is no subject of investigation specified . any complaint involves a subject . even when the subject of investigation involves more than one person , there is still a subject . for instance , the attorney general cited a group of four or five persons , but i still think that they form a subject of investigation . the law does not specify that a subject of investigation must have reasonable grounds to be suspected , and that he is the only person left and is about to be prosecuted . i do not think that this is the way the law should be interpreted . as long as it is clear that there is a complain about someone and there are reasons that he should be investigated , even though there may be more than one person , a subject of investigation is already established . therefore , under the circumstances , i think that an overwhelming majority ( even though not all ) of investigations ought to have a subject . of course , the icac or the attorney general may argue that sometimes when they receive complaints about some likely corrupt activities in certain areas , they have to start to pay attention to it . however , the icac may receive a large number of such complaints while the areas of concern can also be very wide . does that mean that every time when they have to pay attention to certain activities or show their concern about any corruption in a government department , they can claim that " this investigation should be protected " once a file is set up but the subject of investigation is not yet known ? mr chairman , in the beginning of my speech , i mentioned that we are willing to put up with section 30 because the administration has agreed to make amendments . it is also my opinion that the application of section 30 should not be extended unnecessarily . therefore , in the light of my analysis earlier , i think the so - called worry of the administration that an initial investigation will not be protected is excessive . in fact , as i have reiterated a moment ago , it should never be difficult to find a subject . it is because if there is no subject at all , i doubt that this is really a substantial investigation . based on this point , i oppose the administration 's amendment . i hope that the original version can be retained , that is , the provision can only apply when there is a subject of investigation . the second controversial point is also a major area of my amendment today . the issue is the burden of proof if the prosecution uses section 30 . it must be proved that the disclosure is likely to prejudice the investigation in order to convict the defendant . in this regard , i have to point out that suppose there are three situations where an investigation can be prejudiced , one situation will be " truly causing prejudice or damage to the investigation " . i am not seeking this situation as it is in fact very difficult to prove it . someone has also said that it is not easy to really prove how an investigation has been prejudiced , such as someone may be tipped off and as a result , the evidence is destroyed and some witnesses may even take flights . i am not seeking that . nor am i seeking to prove that the person who disclosed the information has a motive to prejudice the investigation with intention . i do not want such a proof , as it is very difficult to prove the motive . i only ask for one thing and that is , when dealing with the disclosure of information , the court should make an objective judgement based on the situation of individual cases to see whether the disclosure will cause any prejudice to the investigation . this is the easiest to prove among the three situations but i think that it is still necessary . it is because as a matter of fact , under many situations , a disclosure of information simply may not affect and will not prejudice an investigation . if section 30 can still be applied to convict a person , then we feel that this is extremely unfair . mr chairman , we have also considered the opinions of some honourable colleagues . they doubt that if it is thus written , the result may be unclear and it will be difficult to predict the decision of the court . however , simply because of this , the inclusion of this stipulation will not reduce the function of section 30 either . so when some people are prepared to disclose certain information , they should think clearly whether they will be prosecuted because of this . the provision still carries this function . the most important thing is : if we say it is impossible or there is no way to prove whether a disclosure will prejudice an investigation , then how come there are some reasons for defence that the disclosure of information can be proved to be beneficial to the public interests and public order ? how can this be proved ? based on the objective condition , the court will draw a conclusion after looking at all the circumstantial evidence . i cannot see why people say that this will render the administration unable to prove its case . i think that is unacceptable . the honourable bruce liu from the hong kong association for democracy and people 's livelihood has indicated his concern that the presence of this provision will render the reputation of a third party easily damaged . i really cannot understand the grounds for his argument . it is because as we all know , when we actually consider section 30 , our main consideration is , if necessary , how to ensure that the investigation will not be unreasonably and unscrupulously disclosed to the effect that some witnesses may be tipped off and then make some moves to undermine that investigation . all along , we think that the protection of reputation can be dealt with under the existing law of defamation . we also cannot see how my addition of the part " likely to prejudice an investigation " can be related to the protection of reputation . the honourable mrs selina chow attaches great importance to the opinions given by the privy council . but i have to emphasize that when the law lord at the privy council commented whether the investigation would be prejudiced , he explained it in two sections . the first section dealt with whether actual damage was caused . he said that it was very difficult and perhaps even impossible to prove . the second section dealt with whether prejudice was likely to be caused . he said that it was rather difficult . the word that he used was " difficult " and not " impossible " . i agree that there is a certain degree of difficulty , but it is not impossible . the judge can make his decision according to each individual case . we feel that if the administration is going to make use of this particular provision to restrict freedom of the press , and if it is going to make prosecution under this provision , it should bear a greater burden of proof . what is more important is that when the privy council made its remarks , it only commented on whether it was consistent with the bill of rights . it was based on this idea that the privy council determined whether section 30 was in line with the bill of rights , without commenting on the merits if these factors were added to the provision . the most important thing is ( and i would like to emphasize this point ) when considering whether investigation would be prejudiced , whether the privy council was aware that there has been a similar provision in the english law stipulating that the media are forbidden to disclose an investigation relating to " money laundering " . was the law lord aware that there has been in fact such a provision ? the provision clearly states that if the media or a third party has illegally disclosed the information , it has to be proved that this is likely to prejudice the investigation . this is the first example . the second example is that in new south wales in australia , there is also a similar provision in the anti-corruption legislation . it stipulates that if any suspect , after receiving from the anti-corruption organization a warrant or summon with a stated restriction on disclosure , discloses the details and is thus prosecuted , it has to be proved , under the burden of proof , that the disclosure concerned has prejudiced the investigation . the above information , about the restriction on disclosure of details by the news media imposed in other countries , is provided by the university of hong kong to the icac review committee . as the information is provided by the university of hong kong , although i have not checked to verify it , i believe that what is quoted is accurate . all in all , it is our opinion that this provision should be introduced to add to the administration 's burden of proof . it is because we find it very important for the media to exercise freedom of the press to supervise the icac under specific conditions so that the public can also enjoy the right to be informed . even with the addition of this provision , i think that the media will still be very careful in their coverage in the future . because it is indeed very difficult to assess whether any disclosure of information is likely to prejudice an investigation . in the light of this point , i believe that my amendment has taken account of a balance between two aspects of the public interest , namely freedom of the press and a certain protection to any investigation . as a matter of fact , my amendment also has the support of the hong kong journalists association and the hong kong bar association . i believe that they , especially the hong kong journalists association , would not just look at this issue in the light of the interests of their own professions . finally , i hope that after listening to my arguments , members will support my amendment . thank you , mr chairman . chairman : members may now debate the attorney general 's motion as well as the respective proposals by mrs selina chow and mr albert ho . miss christine loh : mr chairman , i would like to seek a point of clarification . i am looking at the voting procedures later on . it seems like we will be voting on the attorney general 's motion first , followed by mrs selina chow 's if the attorney general 's amendment should fail , and then by the honourable albert ho 's amendment . i am just wondering that all three amendments could fail . what then would be the position ? chairman : if no second reading of any new clause has been agreed to , the existing section 30 remains standing . miss christine loh : yes , thank you . that is the clarification that i am looking for . chairman : yes , mr james to , a point of order ? mr james to : no . chairman : do you wish to speak ? mr to , please . mr james to : mr chairman , of course i do not want to see such situation as stated in the honourable miss christine loh 's question a moment ago to arise . if that happens , that will mean even the slightest relaxation cannot be achieved and we are returning to the status quo ante . so , the democratic party will later on oppose the administration 's amendment and will also oppose the amendment moved by the honourable mrs selina chow . however , if the amendment of mrs selina chow is carried and in the end this becomes the only alternative , we will also accept it . because otherwise everything will go back to the original position . i agree with the argument just put forward by the honourable albert ho and i only want to add two points . first , mr albert ho has suggested that the disclosure concerned should be a criminal offence only if it is " likely to prejudice " an investigation . mr albert ho has just quoted the examples about the recovery of criminal proceeds in new south wales and the united kingdom . and the example that i am going to quote may be more worthy of our careful consideration . in 1989 , the united kingdom enacted a legislation to deal with terrorists or for the prevention of terrorist activities . and there were a lot of draconian provisions regarding the powers of arrest and investigation of terrorists . people in the united kingdom , the whole world and even the human rights commission all criticized this legislation as too stringent . why was it so stringent ? it was because the united kingdom had to deal with terrorists who were simply impossible to reason with . terrorists plan about explosions and bomb attacks which obviously cause heavy casualties . the damage and horror they cause to the whole society is not less than that caused by corruption . in my opinion , terrorism is even more direct and terrifying than corruption . and yet , when the element of restriction on disclosure was being considered for this legislation in the united kingdom , they also put " likely to prejudice an investigation of terrorist activities " as a criterion for restriction . in other words , despite the critical circumstances in the united kingdom , they still agreed to put " likely to prejudice an investigation " as a prerequisite condition . on the other hand , there is also a similar provision in the drug trafficking ( recovery of proceeds ) ordinance in the laws of hong kong . in fact there is one more condition in this ordinance and that is a disclosure is an offence only if the person concerned knows or suspects that the disclosure is likely to prejudice an investigation . in other words , " likely to prejudice " also needs an intention , albeit as simple as knowing or suspecting a likelihood to prejudice an investigation . nevertheless , mr albert ho 's amendment does not include this point . the reason for my making this comparison is that in the drug trafficking ( recovery of proceeds ) ordinance , we are talking about the situation of " financial tracing " . in other words , it is the recovering of some financial gains . the nature of this investigation is the same as the investigation by the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) investigation about hidden pecuniary gains from corruption activities . the person concerned has to know or suspect that the disclosure is likely to prejudice the investigation . therefore , i hope that when members consider the issue , especially this point , they can pay attention to the question of proportion . it is because in many precedents in connection with the bills of rights , it is stated that when restricting freedom of the press or any other freedom , our means should be proportionate to the social perils that we have to tackle . the second point that i would like to make is that in regard to general investigations or investigations of identified suspects , how should we proceed ? there is only one point that i would like to say . in fact in the ming pao case , i am very dissatisfied with the approach adopted by the government . it is because in the ming pao case , it was obvious that the government did not want to acknowledge that there were some identified suspected persons , suspects or persons under investigation . but actually , any discerning person and people in the community should know �0�0 mr chairman , since this case is already closed , i think therefore that it can be discussed in public �0�0 that there were identified persons under investigation . however , in that particular case , the icac refused to acknowledge this . as a result , the whole investigation and even the prosecution under section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance was overturned by the privy council for technical reasons . i think in that case , it was probably because the suspected persons were some wealthy magnates and major property developers that the icac did not admit the identification of any suspected person , not even to the privy council or the court . but in fact , some suspected persons should have been identified in that case . therefore , i think that the icac had not made full use of its powers in this regard and that it could not blame it on the law . finally , even if either of the amendments moved by mrs selina chow and mr albert ho is carried , will the mass media be bold enough to disclose , and by what means can they get any , information about the internal matters of the icac ? at a certain stage when the information is to be disclosed , how are the media going to know that the icac has already identified the suspected persons ? when they , whether the persons in charge of the media or their legal advisers , are not sure about the situation , they will certainly exercise restraint as they would not know whether they have violated the law or have just reached the borderline . i , therefore , reckon that the concern expressed by the government is only an unnecessary worry . mr james tien : mr chairman , i have to confess i am not very knowledgeable in this subject but , based on what the honourable miss christine loh has just asked , the possibility is based on section 30 . i would just describe the proposal by attorney general as the most restrictive . the amendment moved by the honourable mrs selina chow is a little bit more relaxed , and the amendment by honourable albert ho is even more relaxed . now , at the procedure , if the attorney general 's motion is voted down because of the liberal party and democratic party 's position , and subsequently if the liberal party 's position is voted down by the democrats and others , then at the end , the honourable albert ho 's amendment is again voted down by the liberal party and the rest , we will revert back to the current section 30 , which is the most restrictive of all . now , on that analysis , i would urge the democratic party to really consider voting for mrs selina chow 's amendment . thank you . mr james to : mr chairman , this is not a question about order . i think this is ...... chairman : mr to , i need to call your name first . mr james to : i am sorry , mr chairman . i think the honourable james tien was not asking about a point of order . on the other hand , i would like to ask a question about the order of things . will the chairman consider changing the order of voting so that we will vote on the attorney general 's motion first ? the reason is that the amendment proposed by the attorney general is the most restrictive while the amendment proposed by the honourable albert ho is the most relaxed . if mr ho 's amendment is arranged to be voted in the second place and is then negatived , the democratic party is willing to support the honourable mrs selina chow 's amendment . will the chairman consider the logic in relation to the degree of restrictiveness and make a judgement for the most desirable arrangement ? or we can have a break to consider it if necessary . chairman : honourable members , i think that some members are trying to get myself involved in the debate . i regard both speeches to be speeches , not enquiries . i have ruled that the order of voting on the three alternative new clause 13a should be : the attorney general 's , mrs selina chow 's and then mr albert ho 's . does any other member wish to speak ? if not , i will invite mrs selina chow and mr albert ho as sponsors of alternative new clauses to speak for a second time . mrs selina chow , do you wish to speak ? mrs selina chow : i have nothing to add . miss margaret ng : mr chairman , forgive me , i have been raising my hand but i have not been able to catch your eye . the order of the voting obviously is of very great importance , and section 30 is obviously a very important provision of very great public interest . i wonder , because of how it will affect the outcome , you would agree to rest for a short time so that we could re-think the order of voting so as to make any submissions to you ? 7.49 pm chairman : i suspend the sitting for five minutes . 8.07 pm committee then resumed . chairman : honourable members , as i said earlier , there are three new clause 13a , proposed by the attorney general , mrs selina chow and mr albert ho . they were received at the same time , so i cannot rely on the first - come first - served principle . in deciding on the order of moving the motions on the three new clause 13a , i have had regard to standing order 25 (4) . i have ruled that the attorney general should first move his motion by virtue of his being the public officer in charge of the bill , to be followed by mrs selina chow by virtue of her seniority , and lastly by mr albert ho . it stands to reason that the voting on the three proposals should follow the same order , or else the council will be setting a very bad precedent for the future . i am not prepared to make an exception in this case or in any other case . as the custodian of the rules and practice of this council , my role as the president and as the chairman of the committee of the whole council is to rule on whether or not the propositions are in order and , secondly , the order in which they are to be taken , that is , to be moved and voted on . it is not the president 's or the chairman 's job to involve himself in the merits or otherwise of the alternative propositions . it is a matter for members themselves . so i have taken both mr james tien 's point and mr james to 's point to be speeches . attorney general : the honourable mrs selina chow 's proposal mr chairman , the only difference between mrs chow 's amendment and my own is that her amendment does not plug the loophole that i have mentioned earlier . it would allow disclosures of details of a general investigation , no matter how harmful the disclosure may be to the investigation . i would ask members to consider the example in which a report is made to the icac of the most serious corruption by a member of a senior group of government officials �0�0 corruption striking at the heart of good government . suppose the report does not identify a particular person , but gives information that seems credible , concerning a unit within a certain government department . the icac begin to investigate . they uncover clear evidence of corruption but have not yet identified any particular suspect . then a newspaper publishes details of the investigation . the guilty party flees from hong kong taking his ill - gotten gains with him . just consider what effect that would have on the confidence of the community and their faith in the icac . if members support mrs chow 's amendment , they will be saying that they are content for such publications to take place , regardless of the consequences . therefore , i urge members to support my amendment . if that amendment is negatived , i would urge members however to support mrs chow 's amendment and to reject mr ho 's amendment to which i now turn . the honourable albert ho 's proposal the amendment proposed by the honourable albert ho would also allow disclosures in respect of general investigations . i have already spoken on that and would urge members to reject it . there is , however , a further aspect to mr ho 's amendment . the effect of that amendment would be to limit restrictions contained in section 30 (1) to disclosures which are " likely to cause prejudice to the investigation . " mr chairman , this is unacceptable for two reasons . firstly , it would deprive the section of its role in protecting the reputation of suspects . secondly , it would inadequately protect the integrity of investigations . let me quote from the judgment of the hong kong court of appeal in the ming pao case . " ...... it cannot be assumed that every time an offence under the ordinance has been alleged or suspected to have been committed , and an investigation is underway , it necessarily leads to a person being charged . the allegations and suspicions may , ultimately , turn out to be groundless . the protection of the reputation of suspects , who may have to undergo the opprobrium of investigation over a long period , is a matter of considerable importance : particularly if the suspect is a crown servant having to perform his duties vis - a - viz the public in the meanwhile . no time limit is imposed by statute for the process of investigation . " it is no answer to say that the law of defamation can protect the reputations of suspects . truth is a defence to an action in defamation . a disclosure of the fact that a person is being investigated by the icac , if true , would not therefore give that person any remedy in defamation . the effect of mr ho 's amendment would be that a person could make a malicious report to the icac of corruption by a particular person and then disclose to the media the fact that the person was under investigation . the media could then publish the story , with the result that the person 's reputation was seriously tarnished . provided the disclosures were not likely to prejudice the investigation , no offence would have been committed . it may be argued that persons who are under investigation for non-corruption offences do not have any protection for their reputations beyond that provided by the law of defamation . but corruption offences are in a category of their own , and call for special measures , both to further investigations and to protect those subject to investigation . there are several reasons why corruption suspects need special protection : - a large percentage of allegations received are , after investigation , not substantiated - the icac is under a duty to investigate all allegations and is given special powers to do so - a corruption investigation may continue for a long period of time - a serious stigma attaches to corruption , and those under investigation for corruption , however innocent , may be unfairly tainted . the icac has quite properly been given special powers of investigation , but hand in hand with those powers must go special measures to protect suspects who may be entirely innocent . mr ho 's proposed amendment offers no protection to the reputation of suspects . mr ho 's amendment would also inadequately protect the integrity of investigations . this is not simply the view of the administration . the privy council , in the ming pao case , which so much reference have been made today , made the following comments on the second limb of section 30 subsection (1) , which prohibits disclosures to persons other than the suspect : " lord lester argued that the restrictions in the second limb were disproportionate in that they criminalised disclosures even when no prejudice was caused or likely to be caused to an icac investigation and even if the accused believed that there would be no prejudice . the difficulty about this argument is that in many cases it will be impossible to know whether disclosure has prejudiced an investigation or not , for example , a suspect might destroy incriminating documents of which the investigator was not and never would be aware but which he would have discovered had there been no prior disclosure . for the same reason the suggestion that the desired aim could have been achieved by qualifying the second limb subsection with some such words as " likely to prejudice the investigation " fails because of the difficulty of establishing when a disclosure satisfied the test . if the restriction is to be effective it cannot draw distinctions between prejudicing and non-prejudicing disclosures nor have regard to the state of mind of the discloser . " that was what the five law lords in the privy council had to say . the " likely to prejudice " test would fail to achieve the desired aim of protecting the integrity of icac investigations because of the difficulty of establishing when a disclosure satisfied the test . let me give another example . let us assume that a government official is under investigation but he does not know this . someone in the same department as the suspect learns of the investigation and tells a colleague . the colleague tells someone else , and so on . would any of these disclosures be likely to prejudice the investigation and , if so , which one ? the fact that the suspect may or may not eventually learn of the investigation does not answer the question . the suspect may overhear a conversation that was not , of itself , likely to prejudice the investigation . if he then destroys all evidence of his corruption , the disclosure would still not have been an offence . even if the suspect is informed of the investigation by a colleague , that does not necessarily mean that the disclosure was likely to prejudice the investigation . under the " likely to prejudice " test , it is not clear whether it would be an offence for a person to disclose to a suspect the fact that he was under investigation . it is in general terms unacceptable from a legal policy point of view that a criminal offence should be subject to such uncertainty . these examples show that the " likely to prejudice " test does not adequately protect icac investigations . i am aware that a similar test appears in certain other pieces of legislation . but that , mr chairman , proves nothing . two of the precedents for the " likely to prejudice " test relate to investigations into drug trafficking and terrorism which we have heard this afternoon . investigations into such offences are of a completely different nature to investigations into corruption . let me once again quote from the privy council decision . this is what they have to say : " the fact that disclosure of investigations into other offences is not so severely restricted does not render the provisions of section 30 (1) disproportionate or unnecessary . in many offences involving dishonesty there will be a party who suffers and who has an obvious interest to report the matter to the authorities with the result that the offender can expect that some investigation into the offence will take place . in cases of bribery , however , neither party to the transaction is likely to have any interest to report the matter rather the reverse , since both are likely to be satisfied with what has occurred . this means that bribery offences are particularly difficult to detect and the maintenance of secrecy as to an investigation is even more important in order not to put the suspect on his guard . " once again , i emphasize that those are the views of the five eminent law lords in the privy council . i am also aware that the anti-corruption legislation of new south wales contains the " likely to prejudice test " . however , in february of this year , the australian royal commission into the new south wales police service published an interim report , dealing with police corruption . the report concluded that the internal anti-corruption work of the new south wales police service , and the anti-corruption work of the elements of the new south wales icac that targeted the police , had failed . the report recommended that a new agency be established and that the agency be given " an appropriate secrecy provision " . i trust that i have said enough to indicate how dangerous it is to point to a precedent from another jurisdiction and assume both that the precedent is effective in that jurisdiction and that it would be effective here . in contrast to the position in new south wales , the success of the anti-corruption work of the icac in hong kong is widely recognized . the report of the icac review committee stated that : " almost all submissions acknowledged the success of the icac in combating corruption and bringing it under control . they perceived the danger of a significant increase in corruption during the run - up to 1997 and expressed a belief that the independence and effectiveness of the commission remained crucial to the continued development and prosperity of the community . " one of the reasons for the icac 's success , i believe , is the protection afforded to the integrity of investigations by section 30 . at this crucial time in hong kong 's history , we should not be putting the effectiveness of the icac at risk by weakening the main elements of section 30 . the " likely to prejudice test " would do just that . for all these reasons , i strongly urge members of this council to vote against mr ho 's amendment . thank you , mr chairman . question on the attorney general 's motion put and negatived . chairman : as the attorney general 's motion on the second reading of his proposed new clause 13a has not been agreed , i will now call on mrs selina chow to move the second reading of her proposed new clause 13a . mrs selina chow : mr chairman , i move that new clause 13a as set out under my name in the paper circulated to members be read the second time . question on the motion proposed and put . voice vote taken . the chairman said he thought the " ayes " had it . mrs selina chow and mr tsang kin - shing claimed a division . chairman : committee shall proceed to a division . chairman : members may wish to be reminded that they are now called upon to vote on the question that the new clause 13a moved by mrs selina chow be read the second time . will members please press the top button and then proceed to vote by choosing one of the three buttons below ? chairman : are there any queries ? members may wish to check their votes . the result will now be displayed . mr allen lee , mrs selina chow , mr lau wong - fat , mr edward ho , mr ronald arculli , mrs miriam lau , mr frederick fung , mr eric li , mr henry tang , dr samuel wong , dr philip wong , mr howard young , mr james tien , mr chan kam - lam , mr chan wing - chan , miss chan yuen - han , mr paul cheng , mr cheng yiu - tong , mr cheung hon - chung , mr choy kan - pui , mr david chu , mr ip kwok - him , mr ambrose lau , dr law cheung - kwok , mr lee kai - ming , mr bruce liu , mr lo suk - ching , mr mok ying - fan and mr ngan kam - chuen voted for the motion . mr martin lee , mr szeto wah , mr albert chan , mr cheung man - kwong , mr chim pui - chung , mr michael ho , dr huang chen - ya , miss emily lau , mr lee wing - tat , mr fred li , mr james to , dr yeung sum , mr wong wai - yin , miss christine loh , mr lee cheuk - yan , mr andrew cheng , dr anthony cheung , mr albert ho , mr lau chin - shek , mr law chi - kwong , mr leung yiu - chung , miss margaret ng , mr sin chung - kai , mr tsang kin - shing , dr john tse , mrs elizabeth wong and mr yum sin - ling voted against the motion . the chairman announces that there are 29 votes in favour of the motion and 27 votes against it . he therefore declares that the motion is carried . chairman : as mrs selina chow 's motion on the second reading of her proposed new clause 13a has been agreed , it is not possible for mr albert ho to move the second reading of his proposed new clause 13a . clause read the second time . mrs selina chow : mr chairman , i move that new clause 13a as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members be added to the bill . proposed addition new clause 13a that the bill be amended , by adding �0�0 " 13a . offence to disclose identity , etc. of persons being investigated section 30 is amended by repealing subsection (1) and substituting - " (1) any person who knowing or suspecting that an investigation in respect of an offence alleged or suspected to have been committed under part ii of this ordinance is taking place , without lawful authority or reasonable excuse , discloses to - ( a ) the person who is the subject of the investigation ( the " subject person " ) the fact that he is so subject or any details of such investigation ; or ( b ) the public , a section of the public or any particular person the identity of the subject person or the fact that the subject person is so subject or any details of such investigation , shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of $20,000 and to imprisonment for 1 year . " . " . question on the addition of the new clause proposed , put and agreed to . new clause 13b offence to disclose identity , etc. of persons being investigated clause read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to standing order 46 (6) . chairman : both the attorney general and miss christine loh have given notice to propose the addition of new clause 13b to the bill . i will call upon the attorney general to speak and move the second reading of his proposed new clause 13b first as he is the public officer in charge of the bill . attorney general : mr chairman , i move that new clause 13b as set out under my name in the paper circulated to members be read the second time . the existing subsection ( 1a ) of section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance provides that the restrictions on disclosure cease to apply after the person who is the subject of the investigation has been arrested . under my proposed amendment , the restrictions would also cease to apply after a warrant has been issued for the arrest of the person who is the subject of the investigation , or after a restraining order has been served on any person under section 14c (3) of the ordinance . where an arrest warrant is issued , the investigation will clearly have reached a mature stage and have a specific direction , similar to that where a person is actually arrested . a restraining order prohibits a particular person from disposing of , or otherwise dealing with specified property . such an order will only be made after considerable investigations have taken place . in addition , such orders give rise to a degree of publicity in that , if they relate to immovable property , they are registered in the land registry . the administration therefore considers that , if an arrest warrant is issued or a restraining order is made , it is difficult to justify continuing the restrictions of section 30 . the existing subsection (2) of subsection 30 provides that the commissioner , icac , may disclose the identity of a suspect if any of five specified events occur . two of those events are the issue of an arrest warrant and the making of a restraint order . as i have just explained , the occurrence of either of those two events will , under my proposed amendment , cause all restrictions on disclosure to be lifted . that leaves three further events in the existing subsection (2) , namely , where the person subject to the investigation fails to comply with a notice under section 14 (1) ( a ) or ( b ) requiring him to give details of his assets ; where his residence has been searched under a warrant issued under section 17 ; and where he has been required to surrender a travel document under section 17a . the amendment that i am moving will have the effect that , if any of those three events occur , any details of the investigation may be disclosed by the commissioner , or by the subject person , or by any other person with the consent of the commissioner or the subject person . mr chairman , this is a considerable relaxation of the section , but it ensures that third parties will not be able to disclose details of an investigation after one of the specified events has occurred , unless the commissioner or the suspect consents to this . the administration considers that , even though one of those events has occurred , there are still good reasons for imposing such restrictions on disclosures . in particular , there is still a need to protect the reputation of the subject person . as i have said , in the three situations described , third parties should not be permitted to make disclosures without the consent of the subject person or of the commissioner . however , my amendment provides that , where the commissioner or the subject person has consented to a disclosure being made by a particular person to the public or a section of the public , he is to be treated as having consented to such a disclosure by any other person . this provision will be of particular assistance to the media since , if the subject person is content for details of the investigation to be made public , it will not be necessary for each newspaper or broadcaster to obtain the consent of that person before it can run the story . the amendment i am moving will also permit disclosures to be made by any person if , but only to the extent that , the disclosure reveals any unlawful activity , abuse of power , serious neglect of duty , or other serious misconduct by the icac ; or a serious threat to public order or to the security of hong kong or to the health or safety of the public . the combined effect of these amendments will relax the restrictions imposed by section 30 in significant respects . thank you , mr chairman . question on the attorney general 's motion on second reading of the clause proposed . chairman : as miss christine loh has also given notice to propose the addition of new clause 13b to the bill , i propose to have the attorney general 's motion and miss loh 's proposal debated together in a joint debate . committee shall debate the attorney general 's motion and miss christine loh 's proposal in a joint debate . i will call upon miss christine loh to speak on the attorney general 's motion as well as her own proposition , but will not ask miss christine loh to move the second reading of her motion unless the attorney general 's motion has been negatived . if the attorney general 's motion is agreed , that will by implication mean that miss christine loh 's proposal is not approved . miss christine loh : mr chairman , let me begin by mentioning the two points of agreement between the attorney general 's amendment and mine . first , there is no dispute that section 30 should cease to apply to an investigation after the suspect 's arrest or issue of a warrant for his arrest or service of a restraining order in connection with the investigation . second , both amendments only come into play at a mature stage in the investigation when secrecy is neither possible nor needed . both my amendment and the attorney general 's , therefore , permit the suspect himself to publicize the investigation freely . protecting the integrity of investigation is not in issue here , so let us put that aside in case there are any members of the council who are still pondering about this particular issue . the difference between the two amendments lie in their treatment of three overt acts by the icac against the suspect . these acts are : confiscation of the suspect 's travel documents ; search of his home ; and service of a section 14 notice compelling him or her to divulge information about his or her assets . my amendment proposes to terminate the application of section 30 after any of these acts . the administration 's amendment also relaxes section 30 in similar circumstances but only to the extent authorized by the suspect or by the commissioner of the icac . the administration claims that the approach it takes is necessary to protect the suspect 's reputation . mr ip kwok - him , the honourable mrs selina chow and mr bruce liu all took up this argument in their second reading debate and said that they intended to vote against my amendment . i urge them to listen to my explanation . i would like to put it to them that once an investigation reaches the advanced stage whether either of the two amendments comes into play , such concern over reputation is no longer appropriate . the amendments we are debating do not concern the investigation of raw corruption allegations when there may be little or no real evidence to implicate the suspect . these amendments only come into play after the icac has already uncovered significant , and i repeat , mr chairman , significant evidence that the suspect is guilty . before the icac may serve a section 14 notice or confiscate travel documents , it must satisfy a court that it has reasonable grounds to suspect the targeted person is guilty . this is exactly the same degree of suspicion required to arrest that person . significant suspicion is also required before a court will issue a warrant to search a suspect 's home and the court must be shown reasonable cause to believe his or her home contains evidence of an offence he or she committed . being a lawyer , the honourable bruce liu will , i am sure , appreciate this . when the icac has already uncovered significant evidence of a person 's corruption , this should moderate concern that an innocent reputation is at stake and tilts the balance in favour of treating the corruption suspect like any other suspect . that is , free speech should be allowed subject to defamation laws . that is why the new section 30 ceases to apply after the suspect is arrested as it was amended by this council in 1992 . the same considerations apply when , on the basis of the same or similar suspicion , the icac chooses not to arrest a suspect immediately but does confiscate his or her passport or search his or her home or serve him or her with a section 14 notice . the administration points out that a person whose home is searched , or whose passport is confiscated , may nonetheless later be found to be innocent . the administration fails to mention that this applies as well to a person who is arrested who may in fact never be charged or against whom all charges may be dropped later . but observations of this type miss the point . the point is that these are all major overt actions by the icac taken only at the advanced stage of an investigation on the basis of significant evidence against the suspect . i argue , therefore , that section 30 should cease to apply after any of them . the administration instead errs dangerously in the opposite direction . in the name of protecting reputation , the administration in effect gives the suspect the power to control publicity about the investigation . under the administration 's amendment , it is the suspect who determines what details of the investigation may lawfully be publicized and to whom such disclosure may be made . this extraordinary power to tailor section 30 for a suspect 's own benefit will not be available to a suspect in the early stages of an investigation when there is often no real evidence that he or she committed any offence . rather the administration 's amendment exclusively benefits suspects against whom the icac has already taken overt action on the basis of significant evidence of corruption . mr chairman , that does not seem to make sense to me . the icac will also retain its own comparable power to authorize selective publicity . the administration 's amendment will predictably give rise to battles of disclosure fought in the media as media - savvy suspects and the icac launch competing disclosures to influence public opinion . both the suspect and the icac in these battles will be armed and armoured by the amended section 30 as proposed by the attorney general . the victim in such battles will be the public 's unprotected rights to full and accurate information . a reporter who publishes any detail that has not been authorized by either the commissioner or the suspect will still be criminally liable under section 30 as amended by the attorney general regardless of the report 's accuracy . again the better approach is simply to terminate section 30 's application to the investigation instead of making it selectively permeable to both the interested parties . for these reasons , the administration 's partial relaxation of section 30 at the advanced stage of investigation is not a sensible approach . i urge members to give what i said good consideration and to support my amendment instead . chairman : members will now debate the attorney general 's motion and miss christine loh 's proposal together . mr james to : mr chairman , first of all i would like to say that there is one thing in common in the amendment proposed by the honourable miss christine loh and the amendment moved by the government regarding section 30 (3) of the prevention of bribery ordinance . i would like to tell members that in the course of scrutinizing the bill , the bills committee had spent quite a lot of time discussing it and we eventually reached a consensus on this subsection 3 . in this respect , i consider this a great step forward because in the future , the media and the public can make disclosure revealing such extreme cases as any abuse of power , serious neglect of duty or unlawful activities committed by the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) or a serious threat to public order , the security of hong kong or the safety of the public . this is a relaxation of positive effect and of great importance . i agree that the government has made some substantive concessions in this amendment . i also agree that the government has , by an amendment to section 30 (2) , granted certain triggering points of disclosure to the public which originally could only be decided by the commissioner of the icac . for instance , before the amendment , only the commissioner could disclose the arrest of a suspect . but now , after a suspected person has been arrested , the public can be informed immediately and the media can publish the facts . this is a substantive relaxation . in fact , the difference between miss christine loh 's amendment and the government 's lies in their treatment of the three situations which have been discussed by miss loh . the triggering point is whether or not the consent of the suspected person is required . first of all , the government has completely ruled out any argument on this point on the ground that it will affect investigations . as the name of the suspected person can be mentioned , the integrity of investigation by the icac will not be protected by non-disclosure . what we are discussing is merely the protection of reputation . after my analysis , i think the government 's argument can hardly be justified . suppose a person is under investigation by the icac and , as a result , his residence is searched . the icac 's argument is that , after the search , perhaps there will not be any proceedings against that person , not even an arrest in the future . by the same token , if a person 's residence is searched by the police for being suspected of possessing dangerous drugs or other illegal matters , the police may not arrest the person after the search either . nevertheless , the fact is that the media can report on the police 's search of that person 's place but they cannot report on the search if it is done by the icac , not even any detail or whose residence it is . i personally do not think the damage to reputation caused by an icac investigation could be more serious than that caused by a police investigation at any rate . if a public figure is alleged of possessing dangerous drugs , i believe this will be a major event . if there is an allegation that a listed company , whether its chairman or a director , is involved in a commercial fraud case and is under the investigation of the commercial crime bureau , it will also be a major event . so i do not agree that a search by the icac of one 's residence will cause such a great damage to one 's reputation that protection is needed while protection is not needed if the search is done by the police or other law - enforcing agencies . i think this is just unreasonable . the third point came up to my mind at three o'clock this morning . in fact , a triggering point in miss loh 's amendment is that disclosure can be made once a restraining order has been served by the icac under section 14 of the prevention of bribery ordinance . in my opinion , one more point should be included in order to bring it to perfection . as the government has agreed that the suspected person can be ordered to produce accounts and books on application to the high court under section 13 of the ordinance , i think the triggering point in either the government 's amendment or miss loh 's should have the additional wording of " and section 13 " in section 14 for the same reasoning . finally , i would like to clarify that my speech earlier in the debate might have caused some misunderstanding by the government . when i mentioned the investigation by the icac in the ming pao case , i did not mean that the government had told lies . what i meant was that the government or the icac had made a misjudgement at that time . in my opinion ( of course you may also say that i have made a misjudgement too ) , the icac could have judged at the time that in fact there was already a specified or identified suspect rather than what it said that no suspect had yet been identified . i do not have the slightest intention to say that the icac deliberately told lies or that it answered in the negative even though a suspect had clearly been identified . that was not what i meant and i have to make a clarification . mr bruce liu : mr chairman , thank you for letting me speak . there might have been a misunderstanding when my words were translated into english so that the honourable miss christine loh thought the hong kong association for democracy and people 's livelihood ( adpl ) did not support her . in fact , the adpl supports miss loh 's amendment . thank you , mr chairman . miss christine loh : mr chairman , i am most pleased by the honourable bruce liu 's comments , so let us get on with the vote . thank you . attorney general : mr chairman , under the amendment proposed by the honourable miss christine loh , section 30 would cease to apply where a notice is served on the subject person under section 14 (1) ( a ) or ( b ) ; where his residence has been searched under a warrant issued under section 17 ; or where he has been required to surrender his travel document under section 17a . the administration strongly opposes this amendment , because of its possible impact both on a suspect 's reputation and on icac investigations . subject 's reputation in the three situations i have described , there is still a need to protect the subject person 's reputation . there is no reason why section 30 should cease to apply simply because a person has been required to give details of his assets . needless to say , that person may be entirely innocent and may , by complying with the notice , establish this to the satisfaction of the icac . a search of the suspect 's residence may reveal no evidence of criminality and , if the suspect is required to surrender his travel document , he may subsequently get it back . in none of these situations is there any compelling reason why details of the investigation should be freely disclosed , and the subject person 's reputation ruined . however , if the subject person wished to disclose details of the investigation ; or there has been serious icac misconduct ; or there is a serious threat to public order or to the security of hong kong or to the health or safety of the public , disclosure will be possible under the amendment i am moving . miss loh has argued that section 30 should cease to apply if any of the three events i have mentioned has occurred , since the same degree of suspicion is required for those events as for the arrest of the subject person . with respect to her , this is not an adequate justification . a suspect 's reputation should not be exposed to attack merely because there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that he has committed a corruption offence . as i have explained earlier this afternoon , there are valid reasons for protecting the reputation of those under icac investigation . that protection should only be removed if there is a compelling reason to do so . the arrest of the suspect , or the issuing of a warrant of arrest , indicates that the investigation has reached a mature stage , and that the suspect has been deprived , or will be deprived , of his liberty . members of the public have an overriding right to be informed of this . the making of a restraint order in respect of land already involves public registration , and so it is difficult to justify further restraints on disclosure . but miss loh is proposing that all restrictions on disclosure should be lifted after three events which merely form part of ongoing investigations , and which are not of such significance that there is an overriding reason for the public to know about them . i do not believe that a suspect 's reputation should be so exposed . protection of investigations i turn now to the protection of the integrity of an investigation . miss loh has argued that there is no practical need for secrecy after any of the three events had made the suspect aware of the investigation . there is a fallacy in her argument . it assumes that all suspects who know they are under investigation will tip - off any other guilty parties . this is not the case . firstly , the suspect may be entirely innocent and may not know who the guilty parties are . he will not tip them off . why should third parties be permitted to disclose details of the investigation and thereby alert the guilty parties ? secondly , the suspect may be guilty and may be assisting the icac by giving evidence against his co-conspirators . in that situation , he will not want to tell the co-conspirators what he is doing . third parties should not be permitted to do so . in contrast to miss loh 's proposed amendment , my amendment does afford protection to an investigation in situations where neither the commissioner nor the suspect wants to disclose any details of it . conclusion mr chairman , the administration objects to miss loh 's proposed amendment because it affords inadequate protection to the reputation of suspects and to the integrity of investigations . the amendment i have moved will relax the restrictions imposed by section 30 in several important respects , whilst still affording adequate protection to reputations and investigations . i urge members to support the administration 's amendment . question on the motion put . voice vote taken . the chairman said he thought the " noes " had it . mr james to claimed a division . chairman : committee shall proceed to a division . chairman : i would like to remind members that they are now called upon to vote on the question that the attorney general 's new clause 13b be read the second time . will members please register their presence by pressing the top button and then proceed to vote by choosing one of the three buttons below ? chairman : members may wish to check their votes . are there any queries ? the result will now be displayed . mr allen lee , mrs selina chow , mr lau wong - fat , mr edward ho , mr ronald arculli , mrs miriam lau , mr eric li , mr henry tang , dr

the motion and 31 votes against it . he therefore declared that the motion was negatived . chairman : as the attorney general 's motion on the second reading of his proposed new clause 13b has not been agreed , i will now call on miss christine loh to move the second reading of her proposed new clause 13b . miss christine loh : mr chairman , i move that new clause 13b as set out under my name in the paper circulated to members be read the second time . question on the second reading of the clause proposed , put and agreed to . clause read the second time . miss christine loh : mr chairman , i move that new clause 13b as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members be added to the bill . proposed addition new clause 13b that the bill be amended , by adding �0�0 " 13b . offence to disclose identity , etc. of persons being investigated section 30 is amended by repealing subsections ( 1a ) and (2) and substituting - " (2) subsection (1) shall not apply as regards disclosure of any of the descriptions mentioned in that subsection where , in connection with such investigation - ( a ) a warrant has been issued for the arrest of the subject person ; ( b ) the subject person has been arrested whether with or without warrant ; ( c ) the subject person has been required to furnish a statutory declaration or a statement in writing by a notice served on him under section 14 (1) ( a ) or ( b ) ; ( d ) a restraining order has been served on any person under section 14c (3) ; ( e ) the residence of the subject person has been searched under a warrant issued under section 17 ; or ( f ) the subject person has been required to surrender to the commissioner any travel document in his possession by a notice served on him under section 17a .

" . question on the addition of the new clause proposed , put and agreed to . crimes ( amendment ) bill 1995 clauses 1 , 3 and 4 were agreed to . clauses 2 , 5 and 6 attorney general : mr chairman , i move that clauses 2 , 5 and 6 be amended as set out under my name in the paper circulated to members . when considering the bill , members of the bills committee were concerned that the bill sought to incorporate into law provisions in relation to the definition of " attempt " and the offence of incitement which were only recommended by the english law commission but not yet enacted in england . in england , incitement to commit an offence still remains a common law offence despite its presence in the draft criminal code . members of the bills committee were concerned that , unlike attempt or conspiracy , the merit of codifying the offence of incitement has not been tested in england . the administration accepts that this may not be the appropriate time to codify the offence of incitement . accordingly , i will shortly move a committee stage amendment to delete the relevant provisions in the bill in respect of that offence . however , mr chairman , we will keep this matter under review , tracking developments in england and elsewhere since i believe that there remain sound reasons for eventually putting incitement into codified form . i now turn to the committee stage amendments to clause 2 . the amendments to clause 2 delete the definition of " fault element " and an intention to commit an offence in relation to attempting an offence and delete the proposed codification of incitement as an offence . the proposed new section 159h defines what constitutes the offence of attempting to commit an offence . it further provides that , and i quote , " an intention to commit an offence is an intention with respect to all elements of the offence other than fault elements except that recklessness with respect to a circumstance suffices where it suffices for the offence itself . " the purpose of this section is to provide for circumstances where it is an offence to do an act recklessly . it will also be an offence for a person to be reckless in attempting to do that act . this section follows a decision of the english court of appeal in a case of attempted rape . although the criminal attempts act 1981 does not contain a similar revision , the english law commission recommended such a clause in its draft criminal code for the protection of victims against violent or drunken offenders . in the course of examining the proposed section 159h , members of the bills committee have considered the position by referring to various precedents in england after the enactment of the criminal attempts act 1977 . they take the view that such a provision may be of little use since the english case law suggests that the courts accept that , where recklessness with respect of a circumstance suffices for the substantive offence , then recklessness as to those specific circumstances should be enough for the offence of attempt . the bar association also shares the view that the inclusion of such a clause in the bill is not appropriate . members of the bills committee have also come to the view that the concept of " fault element " is new to hong kong and there are few precedents available to be of assistance if interpretation of the term is called into question . in the light of the comments of the members of the bills committee and the bar association , i accept that it is not entirely clear whether the proposed provisions will produce the desired result at this point in time . in this regard , i will move an amendment to delete subsection (2) of proposed new section 159h in its entirety . in addition , proposed new section 159g , which provides for the definition of " fault element " and subsection (4) of proposed new section 159j , which defines an intention to commit an offence of attempt under other enactments in the same manner as section 159h subsection (2) , should likewise be deleted . the amendment also deletes from clause 2 proposed new sections 159m , 159n and 159o which would have codified the offence of incitement . consequential amendments are made to clauses 5 and 6 . mr chairman , i beg to move . proposed amendments clause 2 that clause 2 be amended �0�0 ( a ) by deleting the proposed section 159g . ( b ) by deleting the proposed section 159h (2) . ( c ) by deleting the proposed section 159j (4) . ( d ) by deleting the heading " incitement " before the proposed section159m . ( e ) by deleting the proposed section 159m . ( f ) by deleting the proposed section 159n . ( g ) by deleting the proposed section 159o . clause 5 that clause 5 be amended , by deleting the clause and substituting �0�0 " 5 . reference to an offence to include aiding , etc. section 101c (1) ( i ) and ( iii ) is repealed . " . clause 6 that clause 6 be amended , by deleting paragraphs ( a ) and ( b ) and substituting �0�0 " ( a ) in subsection (1) , by repealing " subsections (2) , (3) and (4) " and substituting " subsection (2) " ; ( b ) by repealing subsections (2) ( b ) and (4) . " . question on the amendments proposed . mr ambrose lau : mr chairman , i rise to support the amendments that the attorney general has just moved as they are the result of detailed deliberation by the bills committee which i chaired to study the bill . in the course of deliberation , the bills committee reviewed the definition of the offence of attempt . it found that the term " fault element " might create problems and confusion in operation . its inclusion would render the hong kong legislation different from that of the english legislation and would thus put in doubt the value of precedents of the english case law . further , the reference to " recklessness " might confuse rather than clarify the mental element which the english courts have had no difficulty in interpreting under the criminal attempts act 1981 . after full discussion with the administration , the bills committee has agreed that the administration should move committee stage amendments to delete the proposed sections 159g , 159h (2) and 159j (4) from clause 2 of the bill , in order to remove references to " fault element " and " recklessness " in relation to the offence of attempt and in order to bring the definition in line with that of the english criminal attempts act 1981 . regarding the codification of the offence of incitement , since in england , the draft criminal code which restates the existing law in respect of incitement has not been enacted , the majority of members of the bills committee feared that hong kong would be in a difficult position if it were to adopt the draft code in advance . they also queried the proposed codification of incitement , as follows : ( a ) that it may be impractical to codify such a concept of uncertain width ; ( b ) that after codification , the offence may lose the assistance of existing case law ; ( c ) that the new definition of the offence of incitement , particularly the chinese version , may lead more confusion ; and ( d ) the term " incite " is not defined . in the end , the administration conceded that they were unable to convince the bills committee that it is timely to include " incitement " in the condification exercise , although they believe that there are good reasons to do so . the administration has agreed to move amendments to delete the proposed sections 159m , 159n and 159o from clause 2 and to amend clauses 5 and 6 of the bill and that the attorney general has just done . attorney general : thank you , mr chairman . i just want to take this opportunity of thanking the honourable ambrose lau and members of the bills committee for the time and the care which they took over this bill . i would only like to add that the bill in its amended form will be a modest but important step towards the goal of codification , bringing in enhanced accessibility , ease of reference and comprehension and providing for consistency and certainty in its application . thank you , mr chairman . question on the amendments , put and agreed to . question on clauses 2 , 5 and 6 , as amended , put and agreed to . non-local higher and professional education ( regulation ) bill clauses 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 19 , 21 , 23 , 27 , 39 and 40 secretary for education and manpower : mr chairman , i move the amendments to the bill as set out in the paper circularized to members . all the amendments have been agreed to by the bills committee . as for the amendments to clauses 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 16 , 19 , 23 , 27 , 39 and 40 and also certain amendments to clauses 2 , 8 , 10 , 13 and 14 , they are either technical in nature , or are proposed for better or clearer expression of the objectives of the bill . besides , the bills committee is particularly concerned about certain matters when it considered the bill , and i would like to explain the amendments proposed in view of these concerns . protecting students against financial losses one of the major concerns of the bills committee is to protect students against financial losses they would suffer in the event that these courses are prematurely ceased . both the bills committee and the government have agreed that the best way to solve this problem is to limit the amount of advance fees payable to the operators of the courses by students who enroll for them , and to require the operators to make arrangements so that refunds could be made under defined conditions . in order that this method can be put into practice , i move that a new subclause ( e ) be added to clause 10 (3) , so as to provide for a requirement that satisfactory arrangements for payment and refund of course fees is to be a criterion for registration . our principle is that such arrangements are required in order to take care of the operational needs of the courses , and at the same time they also protect students against financial losses in the event that the courses are ceased prematurely . moreover , the bills committee is of the view that there is need for the further restriction on the total sum of advance fees payable to the operators to be limited to three months . the government is agreeable to this restriction , but is of the view that the registrar of non-local higher and professional education courses ( hereafter referred to as the registrar ) should have the discretion when the need arises , for example , if sufficient fund is needed at the start for the operation of these courses , to waive this requirement for the operators . therefore , i move that subclause ( d ) be added to clause 10 (3) of the bill . furthermore , i propose the amendments to clauses 13 (1) and 14 (1) , which empower the registrar to issue the recommendation to cancel the registration of courses and to order the cancellation of the courses in the event that the operators fail to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment and / or refund of fees , or fail to comply with the requirement regarding the collection of course fees in advance . these amendments will be able to ensure that operators will continue to make satisfactory arrangements after the courses have been registered so as to safeguard students ' financial interests . monitoring of exempted courses another concern of the bills committee is the quality assurance of collaborative courses operated by non-local higher institutions and professional bodies ( nhipb ) with local institutions of higher education . the bill provides that the executive heads of local institutions of higher education are required to submit a certificate to the registrar annually to confirm that the courses are collaborative in nature , that the non-local institutions responsible for the collaborative courses have the recognized status , and that the standards of the courses are at a level comparable to courses conducted in the home countries of these non-local institutions before these collaborative courses can be exempted from registration . under this requirement , it is mainly for the local institutions of higher education , instead of the registrar , to be responsible for monitoring and ensuring the quality of the exempted courses . in the course of deliberation , the bills committee was particularly concerned about whether or not the regulation of exempted courses might be too relaxed . whilst the government is aware of the fact that local institutions of higher education are quite experienced in the assurance of quality , and that they will only decide to operate collaborative courses after thorough studies of the information regarding nhipb as well as the details of individual courses , the government is also aware of the fact that there is the need to enhance the transparency and accountability of exempted courses . therefore , i move the following amendments to encourage local institutions of higher education to be more active in ensuring the quality of exempted courses , so as to enable both the registrar and the public to have access to the information of these courses more easily . the amendment i move to clause 2 (1) of the bill and the amendment to schedule 1 which will be moved by me later will specify whether the executive head of the relevant institution refer to the vice chancellor , the president or the director of the institution concerned , so that the persons responsible for submitting the required certificates for exempted courses will be made clear . moreover , i move that clause 8 of the bill be amended by the inclusion of subclause (4) to require that should these certificates be found to be false or incorrect , they will become invalid . i move that subclauses (8) and (9) be added to further permit the registrar to consult experts for advice if necessary in order to verify the contents of the certificates , and to charge local institutions of higher education the expenses incurred in obtaining such advice . i move that clause 8 be amended by adding subclauses (1) ( c ) , (5) , (6) and (7) and that clause 9 be amended , so that the registrar will be able to obtain more information from course operators and / or local institutions of higher education concerning these exempted courses . the registrar may , as the circumstances require , permit the information as well as the certificates of exempted courses and annual reports be made available for inspection by the general public . i also move that clauses 10 (7) and 21 be amended to empower the registrar similarly for him to permit the general public to inspect information and documents obtained from registered operators . furthermore , in order that students who enroll for the exempted courses are safeguarded against financial losses and that their personal safety is protected , i move that subclause ( e ) be added to clause 8 (1) to stipulate that operators of exempted courses must comply with the requirement regarding the payment and / or refund of course fees as well as the requirements regarding the premises in which teaching is conducted . mr chairman , i move the motion . proposed amendments clause 1 that clause 1 (2) be amended , by deleting " , other

month grace period . the two amendments that i moved earlier to clause 1 together with this new clause provide that only the operators of courses currently being conducted are eligible to enjoy the grace period . the purpose is to minimize the effects on the already commenced non-local courses with the enactment of this new law . during the six months after the proposed legislation has come into operation , the operators of such courses may still continue to conduct their courses and put up enrolment advertisements in hong kong . if the operators intend to continue running the courses , they should register the courses or apply for exemption during the grace period . on the other hand , operators who plan to conduct non-local courses in hong kong on or after the day the proposed legislation comes into effect should , in the first place , satisfy the requirements pertaining to registration or exemption for the courses . under this provision , the quality of new courses is ensured prior to their commencement in hong kong . mr chairman , i so move . question on the second reading of the clauses proposed , put and agreed to . clauses read the second time . secretary for education and manpower : mr chairman , i move that new clauses 21a and 40a be added to the bill . proposed additions new clause 21a that the bill be amended , by adding �0�0 " 21a . registrar may obtain advice (1) the registrar may obtain , from the accreditation council or such other person or organization as he thinks fit , such advice as is reasonably required to enable him to verify -

education and manpower and mr edward ho and mr ronald arculli have separately given notices to amend the proposed section 9c in clause 2 . the order of moving amendments is determined in accordance with standing order 25 (4) . mr edward ho has given notice to move an amendment to the proposed section 9c in clause 2 , by adding subsection ( 1a ) . mr ronald arculli has also given notice to move an amendment to the same proposed section 9c by adding subsection ( 1a ) and to add a related new clause 4a . i propose that the amendments proposed by mr edward ho and mr ronald arculli be debated together in a joint debate . committee shall debate the amendments proposed by mr edward ho and mr ronald arculli in a joint debate . i will first call upon mr edward ho to move his amendment by virtue of his seniority . mr edward ho : i move that the proposed section 9c of clause 2 of the bill be amended as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members . mr chairman , first , i have to make it clear that i have moved the amendment on behalf of the bills committee . when i proposed this amendment in the bills committee , it had the unanimous support of members of the committee and no one objected to it . also , i have submitted a report to the house committee and nobody has raised any objection either . in relation to this matter , i am dissatisfied with the remarks which mr joseph wong has recently made in the press and to some members and i believe some of them were misleading . it was reported in the press that " joseph wong is making his final efforts in persuading members to object to the liberal party 's amendment " . the article mentioned my name as well and it seemed to say that my amendment was in fact the liberal party 's amendment . besides , it has also given the public an impression that the liberal party did not support the proposal to enhance safety at the workplace . in fact , the contrary holds true . i will explain later why my amendment would enable the commissioner to enforce the law and to enhance safety at the workplace more effectively . i think i have to give an explanation in this respect . mr joseph wong has objected to my amendment on three grounds . first , the government thinks that it is unnecessary for me to propose the amendment because the administration has already agreed to include the issue of a written notification of the intention to issue a suspension notice as part of the labour department 's procedural guidelines . in this respect , although the government thinks that it is unnecessary , the bills committee considers it necessary . the original provision of the bill was that in the case of an imminent danger to workers , the inspector had to give verbal notice to the proprietor and he would then report to the commissioner for labour and subsequently get a suspension notice issued . the bills committee has considered this provision and concluded that the arrangement is unsatisfactory . if a mere verbal notice was given , it would be difficult to tell what has been related and what has not or whether anything has been related at all . therefore , we urged the administration to change the verbal notice to a written notice . the administration accepted the need to do so and has agreed to issue the notice in written form . however , we do not understand why , despite the administration 's agreement to issue the notice in written form and to include it in the procedural guidelines , it cannot be specified in the law . secondly , mr joseph wong thinks that if my amendment is supported , it will impede the flexibility of the administration in enforcing the law . our amendment ( i say " our " because it has the unanimous support of the bills committee ) has made it clear that it will only be a notice of intention and therefore should not limit the government 's flexibility . since it is only a notice of intention , it will not be binding on the administration 's subsequent action and this is just what we would like to include in the administration 's procedures . thirdly , mr joseph wong said that the contents of the written notice would restrict the commissioner for labour in his subsequent issue of a suspension notice . i have to stress that this is only a notice of intention and it should not be binding on any subsequent action to be taken by the commissioner . besides , if the factory inspector is of the opinion that the situation is very serious �0�0 we certainly expect factory inspectors to base their opinions on a substantial professional judgement because the issue of a suspension notice will have a very serious impact on the factory concerned �0�0 he should exercise his professional judgement and have this intention before seeking to issue a suspension notice . since they have formed their opinions on the basis of professional judgement , why do they have to worry about any possible changes after reporting their cases ? certainly , the ultimate authority to make changes rests with the commissioner , who may , after reading the report , consider the situation not that serious and decide that it is not necessary to issue a notice . alternatively , he may direct that a notice be issued not only on the grounds raised by the factory inspector , but also on other grounds . therefore , i think that the argument suggested by the government cannot stand . the so - called notice of intention can never restrict the administration 's action . mr chairman , members of the bills committee do not wish to create obstacles to make it difficult for the commissioner to act according to this legislation and thus affect safety at the workplace . on the contrary , we have made the proposal in the hope that this procedure can be given a legal status so that industrial safety can be enhanced more effectively . therefore , i think that the ensuing debate is not about supporting or opposing the proposal to enhance safety in construction sites , but rather how this aim can be achieved most effectively . i am looking at the matter in a professional perspective and the honourable ronald arculli will again look at the matter in his professional perspective later on . i think both my proposal and mr arculli 's proposal are realistic and we hope that things can actually be achieved . therefore , i hope that members will support my amendment . thank you . proposed amendment clause 2 that clause 2 be amended , in the proposed section 9c , by adding �0�0 " ( 1a ) immediately upon discovery of any matter which warrants the issue of a suspension notice under subsection (1) , the commissioner for labour shall issue to the proprietor of the industrial undertaking a notice in writing , stating his intention to issue a suspension notice and the matters which will be specified in the suspension notice . " chairman : i now call upon mr ronald arculli to speak on the amendment moved by mr edward ho as well as his own proposed amendments , but will not ask mr ronald arculli to move his amendments unless mr edward ho 's amendment has been negatived . if mr edward ho 's amendment is agreed , that will by implication mean that mr ronald arculli 's proposed amendments are not approved . mr ronald arculli : mr chairman , i completely agree with every word that the honourable edward ho has said in support of his amendment . the difference between mr ho 's amendment and mine is that mine is a little bit more extensive because mine includes , mr chairman , a form that would be issued to the proprietor of an industrial undertaking , indicating to him the areas which the factory inspector will consider issuing a suspension notice . the origin of that form has found its way from the administration . during our deliberations , we were given a guideline by the administration who enumerated a number of possibilities and circumstances under which a suspension notice might be issued , and to be fair to the administration , it concludes by saying that the list is not exhaustive and there could be other circumstances which might occur that could bring about the issue of a suspension notice . so , all i did was copied the form , included an extra paragraph to say " others " , which means other situations or circumstances . so , within the form that i have proposed to be added to the ordinance , there is complete flexibility on the part of the labour department to indicate what were the reasons for a possible suspension notice . now , why did the labour department give us that guideline setting out those instances ? for a very simple reason . we were told that even with a verbal warning to the proprietor of an industrial undertaking , the proprietor would be told the reasons and what was wrong with the set - up and what needed change . we were then further told by the labour department that the factory inspector will go away and try and get the suspension order issued , maybe within a short time but not more than at that time 48 hours , now 24 hours . he will then come back to the industrial undertaking with the suspension order in his pocket . if the offending processes or circumstances were rectified , the suspension notice would be kept in his pocket and he would go away . it will not be served . the whole reason why we asked for it to be in writing is so as to give the proprietor of the industrial undertaking the first possible opportunity , the first possible opportunity , mr chairman , of rectifying what might be a dangerous process , a danger to the workers , a danger to life , limb or indeed perhaps even property . so , we were hoping that the labour department officials would actually tell the proprietor , " look , listen , that process is wrong and that is why it is wrong " , and whilst they are in the process of sorting out the possible suspension notice , the proprietor could call in help or whatever and rectify the process . that is the whole purpose , mr chairman , of the form . now , the administration says , " oh , no , that is too cumbersome . we are not going to give a form because it will tie our hands . " well , i will ask the secretary for education and manpower , in that written notification that he intends to use by administrative measure , does the labour department propose to be helpful , to tell the proprietor what is wrong so that the proprietor can rectify or indeed stop that process so as not to expose any workers to any danger ? if he does not then i would like him to explain why . if he does , what is the difference between the two forms ? is he afraid that the factory inspectors or indeed the labour department will specify wrong reasons or inadequate reasons ? as mr ho has explained , this is intended to help remedy situations that nobody wants to exist , but we need the help of the labour department to do that . we need to be given the opportunity , and that is why the form is suggested in my amendment , and i think i would urge my colleagues in this council to actually make the requirement of serving a notice a legal requirement rather than an administrative measure . if the proprietor gets some wishy - washy notification to say , " oh , i am going to go away and get a suspension notice " , without any reason , how does that help anybody ? we have similar situations , mr chairman , in the building ordinance . if there is a dangerous slope �0�0 which we have been talking about this afternoon �0�0 which requires remedial work , the building authority quite often serves on the owner of the property a notice to say , " i think your slope is dangerous . please put in proposals for remedial works . " that is what happens . it is a prescribed statutory form . he do not write a little letter and by administrative measures , and in those circumstances it may not be an immediate danger to anybody in the property or indeed in the vicinity . even then there is a prescribed statutory form . so , i really cannot understand why there is this incredible objection by a move on my part to ask the labour department actually for help , to help rectify the situation . mr chairman , i think in terms of that particular amendment , i would say to members that , if they decide not to support mr ho 's amendment because they prefer to have a prescribed form , then i would ask them to vote against mr ho 's amendment which , i believe , is indeed an amendment of the bills committee . if they wish to have this prescribed form in a statutory manner because of a statutory duty imposed on the commissioner for labour , they can vote for my amendment and they will give exactly the same remedy except that there will , in fact , be the addition of a form . thank you , mr chairman . chairman : members may now debate the amendment moved by mr edward ho as well as the amendments proposed by mr ronald arculli . miss chan yuen - han : mr chairman , earlier on i have listened to the points made by the honourable edward ho , chairman of the bills committee . i want to clarify here that this bills committee on which we sat held four meetings within a very short time and , unlike what mr ho has said , we have not been able to fully agree on several issues , one of which was whether the issuance of written notices should be included in the law . as regards the suspension notice , we agreed that a notice in writing should be issued in place of a verbal warning . this is acceptable and the government has also accepted our view at that time . but we considered it unnecessary to include the issuance of a written notice in the law . therefore , different views arose within the committee . we do not agree that the issuance of written notice should be included in the law because we consider that in a very urgent situation , a need to consult the law may hold up the development of the whole process . in addition , we are also worried that with the present relatively low conviction rate in respect of construction sites as well as the not so high conviction rate for prosecutions made under some penalty provisions , once the issuance of written notice is included into the law , cases will have to be heard in court and some people who should be punished on account of their negligence of industrial safety may get off the hook . this is the view of some colleagues in the bills committee . i want to say that the views as mentioned by mr ho earlier are not the views of the whole committee but those of some of the members . further , concerning the amendment moved by the honourable ronald arculli , we have a different view . actually , the internal guidelines for the issuance of suspension notices as mentioned by the government have already listed 10 or more items , so we are doubtful whether there is a real need to include the relevant arrangements in the law . besides , as i have mentioned earlier , i am very much worried that the inclusion of such written notices in the law would lead to a low conviction rate in court . from our handling of cases involving industrial safety in the past , we have noticed a certain phenomenon which some safety officers at construction sites and workers have also raised with us . the point is , while the fine currently stipulated by the law is $200,000 , how come for the cases tried in court , the fines imposed were only some $10,000 on average . this is exactly the result of a duplication of procedures which gives rise to difficulties in prosecution . based on this reason , the hong kong federation of trade unions and i object to the amendments moved by mr edward ho and mr ronald arculli . thank you . mr lee cheuk - yan : mr chairman , i speak to oppose the amendments proposed by the honourable edward ho and the honourable ronald arculli . earlier on , mr edward ho said that it was very unfair to him that the government had said that his motion was actually the liberal party 's amendment . i also think that this is unfair to him . however , the question is , i think it is very strange for mr edward ho to say that the amendment has actually been proposed by the bills committee because at the last meeting , it was not mentioned that the bills committee would propose an amendment . i remember it was said at the time that the government had agreed to issue written notice instead of giving verbal notice and i thought that the problem had already been solved . it was also said that mr ronald arculli would propose an amendment , but the wording of the amendment was not yet known to us at that time . nevertheless , i remember clearly that the bills committee itself did not mention anything about moving an amendment to make the written notice a statutory document . we oppose the requirement that makes written notice a statutory responsibility mainly because i think it will lead to two undesirable consequences . first , this requirement would , to a certain extent , bind the factory inspectors who work in the front line . when factory inspectors need to add or alter any items , they will have to first amend the written notice concerned . if so , the 24 - hour rule cannot possibly be observed . suppose the front - line factory inspector has issued a written notice of the improper things at the time of an inspection , but discovers some other problems when he reports the matters to his superior . if reporting to the superior becomes a statutory procedure , then the factory inspector concerned will have to prepare another document afresh in order to amend the previous one . in that case , it may take more time instead of within 24 hours to issue the notice . if so , the dangerous situation will continue to exist . therefore , i am very concerned about this " binding " issue . on the other hand , to a front - line factory inspector , the responsibility to issue a written notice will , to a certain extent , constitute a pressure . the government originally intended to put the responsibility entirely on the shoulders of the assistant chief factory inspector who would make the final decision on whether to issue a suspension notice , and the front - line officers should have no legal responsibility in the making of such a decision . who should be the one to bear the ultimate legal responsibility ? it should be the assistant chief factory inspector . however , if the issuance of a written notice is made a legal requirement , the front - line officers will have to shoulder this responsibility . this is a complete deviation from the principle of accountability as set down by the government . coming to another point , i think the form proposed by mr ronald arculli is so simplistic that it lists only such options as " no railing " without providing for the need to specify at which particular location and on which particular storey the railings are not in place . if it is to be a written notice issued in an administrative process , the particular storey and location where railings are found not in place would have to be specified . i think the form is too vague and general to be of any help to the contractors . the other amendment proposed by mr ronald arculli is that a contractor 's compliance with the suspension notice cannot constitute an evidence of guilt in any future judicial process . mr ronald arculli has said that the amendment was aimed at encouraging contractors to comply with the requirements . i do not oppose the proposal to encourage contractors to comply with the requirements , but the present situation has already come to a head and lives are at stake . although the government is sometimes included to use the carrot and sometimes the stick , yet in view of the extremity of the present situation , i think the stick must definitely be used . the government should make it clear that work has to be suspended and not just encourage contractors to comply with the suspension notice . the penalty for non-compliance should also be clearly stated . this is the time to use the stick . furthermore , i oppose mr ronald arculli 's amendment concerning the inadmissibility of evidence in court because this amendment of his may in some ways produce the side effect of reducing the chance of conviction . since the court cannot take any improvement in compliance with the requirements in the written notice as evidence , it follows that , in a sense , the court cannot accept all the evidence surrounding the case . therefore , it will be to the advantage of the offending employer or contractor . in answering our questions raised at a meeting of the bills committee , our legal adviser has expressed the opinion that compliance with the requirements of the law should not be taken as one of the factors for conviction in court . therefore , the legal adviser has stated clearly that this should not be a cause for concern . finally , i think the most important thing is not to impose any restrictions on the court which should , i hope , consider all evidences . thank you , mr chairman . mr michael ho : mr chairman , the democratic party is against the amendments moved respectively by the honourable ronald arculli and the honourable edward ho to add clauses ( 1a ) and ( 1a ) ( a ) to the bill . however , we welcome the government 's move to change the original verbal notice to a written one . we believe that the administrative measure promised by the government today is sufficient and we accept this administrative measure . we think , however , that it is not really necessary to incorporate this administrative measure into the law because we want to maintain the greatest flexibility , so that suspension notices may be served in the quickest and most convenient way to protect the safety of workers . for the same reason , we will also oppose later mr ronald arculli 's amendment to add clause 4 ( a ) to the bill . thank you , mr chairman . mr ronald arculli : mr chairman , i shall try and be very brief . i think despite all the reasons advanced by my colleagues for not supporting my amendment and for supporting the government 's position , i am still at a loss to understand what their objection is . in terms of a form , my colleague , mr lee cheuk - yan , says that , well , you know , it is inflexible , it does not specify which particular area . look at my form ! there is space to fill it in . if they want to do it , they can do it . but the whole idea is for the factory inspector who now �0�0 the original proposal was to give a verbal warning �0�0 to give it in writing . so , even the letter , however informal , that is going to be issued will be issued by the factory inspector or certainly as a result of what he has seen , not by his superior who is not going to go there to have a look at it just to issue a notice that they intend to go for a suspension notice . on the second point regarding danger , we are not just talking about dangerous situations , we are talking about situations which call for improvement notice . and i still maintain that , in terms of encouraging proprietors of industrial undertakings to act speedily , to co-operate , you have to use carrot and stick . as i said earlier , the fact that the form or the compliance with the notice should not be adduced in court as evidence , does not preclude a prosecution . clearly the factory inspector , when he goes to a site , he will see something that is not right . it is based on what he sees that the improvement notice or suspension notice will be issued . compliance with that does not take the offence away . if an offence has been committed he will see it , so on his evidence there is evidence for the court to act on , but what we want is for the proprietor to act speedily . what we want to do is not just to punish , we want to encourage him to act speedily . we want him not to dispute whether or not the factory inspector is right . we just want him to do as the factory inspector requests . so , if you want people to do that , and yet you tell them that they run the risk of being in court , obviously it is not the perfect solution . if you choose not to support that sort of approach , fine , but i do not want to stand here in a year 's time and say , " i told you so " , if in fact the scheme does not work out as well as all of us hope . mr chairman , i realize that i am probably speaking to deaf ears and i have not even heard the secretary for education and manpower , but in view of his apparent success , i hope that he will be as brief as possible ! secretary for education and manpower : mr chairman , i believe i have to disappoint both the honourable edward ho and the honourable ronald arculli because firstly , i would not comment on the press reports concerning myself or this bill , and secondly , my reply would not be very brief . the government thinks that the amendment moved by mr edward ho is unnecessary and inappropriate , and would create problems . although i am very grateful to mr edward ho for trying to explain the government 's stance on my behalf , i wish to take this opportunity to give an explanation myself . the government does not agree to this amendment for the following reasons : ( a ) first , this amendment proposes that it should be provided in the law that the commissioner for labour has to give written notice of the government 's intention to issue a suspension notice to the proprietors of industrial undertakings . this amendment is unnecessary because the government has already agreed to state in the labour department 's procedural guidelines for the issuance of suspension notices that proprietors of industrial undertakings should be given written notice of the government 's intention to issue a suspension notice . such guidelines will also be published for general information in due course . ( b ) second , the written notice issued under the labour department 's procedural guidelines contains only general information and has no binding effect . only the subsequent suspension notice will be binding on the proprietor concerned . the amendment proposes that the written notice should state clearly the specific items which will be listed in the suspension notice to be issued . this requirement will tie the hands of the commissioner for labour in the subsequent issuance of the suspension notice . the commissioner for labour often has to specify different or additional items or amend those already specified according to the needs of the situation . under such circumstances , the commissioner would have to issue another written notice . it will put an unnecessary burden on both the proprietors concerned and the government . a more important point is that the amendment will weaken the commissioner for labour 's ability to respond flexibly and speedily in situations in which immediate preventive and remedial measures are required . ( c ) thirdly , the proposed amendment will in effect turn an administrative procedure into a statutory requirement . at present , the labour department will , as an administrative procedure , issue an inspection report to the factory proprietor to inform him of any breach of regulations discovered by the staff of the labour department in the inspection . similarly , the various procedures followed by the labour department in the enforcement of the factories and industrial undertakings ordinance , and the various procedures followed by other government departments in the enforcement of the relevant laws , are also administrative procedures . these procedures are formulated to provide flexibility for the authorities concerned in the execution of their duties . therefore , we think that the amendment is unacceptable . on the strength of the above - mentioned reasons , i call upon members to vote against the amendment moved by mr edward ho . just like mr edward ho 's amendment , mr ronald arculli 's amendment also asks the commissioner for labour to give written notice to proprietors of relevant industrial undertakings . however , mr ronald arculli further proposes that the form of the written notice should be prescribed and that the commissioner for labour may amend the form by notice in the gazette . these amendments not only turn administrative procedures into statutory requirements , but also propose to have the form and contents of the written notice , which should rightly be administrative in nature , prescribed in the laws . i have to emphasize that no prescribed form can cover all the various kinds of hazards in industrial undertakings , especially construction sites because the installations , equipments and operation procedures used are potentially dangerous , and chemicals are also used there . if we accept the proposed amendment , any changes in the situation , installations , equipments , operation procedures or the materials used in industrial undertakings would require amendment of the prescribed form by notice in the gazette . this kind of notice has the same status as subsidiary legislation , which means it has to go through the negative vetting procedure for approval under section 34 of the interpretation and general clauses ordinance ( cap . 1 ) . such procedure takes time and will therefore weaken the flexibility which is very much needed by the commissioner for labour to respond to life and death situations . in dealing with such situations , timely and speedy responses are most important . for the above - mentioned reasons and the explanation that i have given earlier on in response to the amendment proposed by mr edward ho , i call upon members to also vote against the amendment moved by mr ronald arculli . thank you , mr chairman . mr edward ho : mr chairman , first of all i need to respond to what mr joseph wong has said . i did not attempt to explain why the government was against me . i only spoke on the three reasons contained in the letter he sent to members today . it is pretty late now , so i do not want to make a long speech . furthermore , i do not want to argue again with members of the bills committee as to who is right and who is wrong , but the legislative council secretariat should have the relevant recordings and notes . i have only a few points to make in response . the honourable miss chan yuen - han said it was sufficient to specify that notification be made an administrative procedure and it was not necessary to specify the same in the law because it had been difficult to make successful prosecutions over the past . i think this is where the issue lies . if people breach the law , the relevant procedures should be specified in the law . this is the spirit of the law in that law - breakers can be successfully prosecuted . if everything was made a matter of procedures in lieu of legislation because of the difficulty in successful prosecutions , that , i think , would be quite inconsistent with the spirit of the law or of legislation . on the other hand , the honourable lee cheuk - yan queried whether front - line factory inspectors should bear the legal responsibilities . i think factory inspectors should act in accordance with the law . even when the procedure is specified in the law , factory inspectors will be working in accordance with the law and within their terms of reference . they should take up these responsibilities but no further . we have been saying the government should be accountable to the public in the sense that we do not want to see the government rely on its own administrative procedures for everything such that reasons given in black and white on the sites can turn out to be completely different after consultation . this is just the situation mr joseph wong referred to because the commissioner may under different circumstances use different reasons . frankly , i do not want to see this happen and i do not think this can be justified . i think i have been speaking for too long and members must have made up their minds already . thank you . question on the amendment put . voice vote taken . the chairman said he thought the " noes " had it . mr edward ho claimed a division . chairman : committee shall proceed to a division . chairman : may i remind members that they are now called upon to vote on the question that the amendment to the proposed section 9c in clause 2 moved by mr edward ho be approved ? will members please register their presence by pressing the top button and then proceed to vote by choosing one of the three buttons below . chairman : members may wish to check their votes . are there any queries ? i think i see one short of 56 . i think we are one short of the head count . the result will now be displayed . mr allen lee , mrs selina chow , mr ngai shiu - kit , mr lau wong - fat , mr edward ho , mrs miriam lau , mr chim pui - chung , mr henry tang , mr howard young , miss christine loh , mr james tien and mr paul cheng voted for the amendment . mr martin lee , mr szeto wah , mr albert chan , mr cheung man -

" . question on the amendment proposed . mr michael ho : mr chairman , the democratic party will oppose the proposed section 9e as moved by the honourable ronald arculli . we oppose it because , firstly , in the course of scrutiny , the legal adviser of this council has clearly advised us that the proposed amendment is unnecessary . a more important point is , we agree that the taking of improvement action by a proprietor in compliance with the items specified in the notice served prior to a suspension notice is no indication that the proprietor admits the commission of an offence . however , in mr arculli 's proposed section 9e , it is stated that the fact of requirements set out in an improvement notice , or of directions set out in a suspension notice , shall not be admissible in evidence against the proprietor . mr chairman , we think it is acceptable that taking action to make improvement is not to be considered as admission of an offence . but to exclude the relevant facts as admissible evidence is a different thing . for this reason , we do not agree to this amendment which seeks to provide by law the exclusion of certain facts for use in court as evidence in prosecution . we believe different types of evidence can be dealt with fairly in court proceedings . therefore , we oppose mr arculli 's amendment . the democratic party does not want to see this amendment resulting in a cut down of evidence usable in prosecution , or becoming an indirect encouragement for those irresponsible proprietors to repeatedly violate industrial safety legislation . i so submit . mr lee cheuk - yan : mr chairman , i do not want to prolong the agony of the honourable ronald arculli . it is only that he has mentioned the improvement notice a moment ago which i did not touch upon in my speech earlier . in regard to this point , i am fairly certain that the administration has told the bills committee that if the proprietor concerned follows the requirements in the improvement notice , he will not be prosecuted under normal circumstances . it is because the improvement notice itself is of a lower level , and thus under the circumstances where there is no imminent danger to human lives , the improvement notice will not be followed by any prosecution . therefore , there is really no need to worry that compliance with an improvement notice will put the proprietor concerned in a disadvantageous position when in court , as no prosecution at all will be made against him . thank you , mr chairman . secretary for education and manpower : mr chairman , the government considers the amendment proposed by the honourable ronald arculli unacceptable for it restricts the scope of evidence that are required to be submitted to the court to prove breaches of law on the part of the proprietor . under the circumstance , the court will be unable to obtain an additional piece of evidence which may be useful for deciding whether the proprietor has violated the law . another adverse effect brought by this proposal is that the offenders are encouraged to violate the law repeatedly . i must also point out that the proposed amendment , if carried , will jeopardize the government 's endeavours to curb serious violation of the law by proprietors . for these reasons , i urge members to vote against the amendment moved by mr ronald arculli . thank you , mr chairman . mr ronald arculli : mr chairman , i am not surprised that the secretary for education and manpower did not refer to the legal advice received by his office because there were two different opinions . mr michael ho , in referring to the opinion given by the legal adviser of this council , again omitted those two references to the legal advice given to this branch . so it was really with that somewhat mixed legal opinion �0�0 as members can understand when you ask lawyers for an opinion , the chances of your winding up with different opinions is actually very high �0�0so , my amendment was actually intended as an avoidance of doubt position and not to preclude , as i said earlier and i repeat , prosecution of offending proprietors who deserve of prosecution , or indeed any other action . but be that as it may , mr chairman , those are the reasons for which i hope members will support this particular amendment . question on the amendment put and negatived . question on clause 2 , as amended by the secretary for education and manpower , put and agreed to . clause 3 secretary for education and manpower : mr chairman , i move that clause 3 of the bill be amended as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members . these are two simple technical refinements . the first amendment is that the words " within the period specified in the notice " are to be deleted from subsection (8) as proposed in clause 3 . since to comply with the period specified in an improvement notice is already one of the terms in that notice , the proposed words to be deleted are indeed superfluous . the second amendment is that the words " the whole or part of " are to be deleted from subsection (9) as proposed in clause 3 . if the proprietor fails to comply with the terms , no matter it is the whole or part of them , he commits an offence . the proposed amendment deletes the unnecessary words . the bills committee has already accepted these two proposed amendments . mr chairman , i beg to move . proposed amendment clause 3 that clause 3 be amended �0�0 ( a ) in the proposed subsection (8) by deleting " within the period specified in that notice " . ( b ) in the proposed subsection (9) by deleting " the whole or part of " . question on the amendment proposed , put and agreed to . question on clause 3 , as amended , proposed , put and agreed to . aviation security bill clauses 1 , 3 , 6 to 11 , 13 , 14 , 16 to 48 , 50 to 57 and 59 to 65 were agreed to . clauses 2 , 4 , 5 , 12 , 15 , 49 and 58 secretary for security : mr chairman , i move that the clauses specified be amended as set out in the paper circularized to members . the amendments put forward are technical in nature . amendments to clauses 4 , 5 , 49 (2) and 58 will remove several minor inconsistencies between the english and chinese texts of the bill . amendments to clauses 15 and 49 (4) seek to rectify two clerical errors . amendments to clauses 2 and 12 will clarify the scope of several provisions relating to explosives . mr chairman , i beg to move . proposed amendments clause 2 that clause 2 (1) be amended , in paragraph ( a ) of the definition of " act of violence " , by adding " or 54 " after " 53 " . clause 4 that clause 4 (4) ( a ) be amended , by deleting " �� " and substituting " � " . clause 5 that clause 5 be amended , by adding " �b " before " " . clause 12 that clause 12 (1) be amended , by adding " or 54 " after " 53 " . clause 15 that clause 15 (2) be amended �0�0 ( a ) in paragraph ( b ) , by deleting everything after " an aerodrome , " . ( b ) by adding after paragraph ( b ) - " in such a way as to endanger or be likely to endanger the safe operation of the aerodrome or the safety of persons in the aerodrome . " . clause 49 that clause 49 (2) ( a ) be amended , by deleting " ����裁0�0���0�0���j� " and substituting " 酴�裁0�0���0�0��ㅔ� " . that clause 49 (2) ( b ) be amended , by deleting " �������j� " and substituting " ��ѽ�ㅔ� " . that clause 49 (4) be amended , by deleting " " and substituting " � " . clause 58 that clause 58 (4) be amended , by deleting " " . question on the amendments proposed , put and agreed to . question on clauses 2 , 4 , 5 , 12 , 15 , 49 and 58 , as amended , put and agreed to . schedules 1 and 2 were agreed to . immigration service ( amendment ) bill 1996 clauses 1 , 3 and 6 to 11 were agreed to . clauses 2 , 4 and 5 secretary for security : mr chairman , i move that the clauses specified be amended as set out in the paper circularized to members these amendments contain the proposed changes to the immigration service ( amendment ) bill 1996 which i have already referred to in the second reading debate and also some technical amendments . they have been discussed in detail by the bills committee and have received the committee 's endorsement . mr chairman , i beg to move . proposed amendments clause 2 that clause 2 ( b ) be amended , by adding �0�0 ( a ) by deleting " deposited " and substituting " been released on bail on his depositing " ; ( b ) in paragraph ( b ) , by deleting " such a member " and substituting " any such member " ; ( iii ) in subsection (4) , by deleting " entered " and substituting " been released on bail on his entering " ; question on clauses 2 , 4 and 5 , as amended , put and agreed to . buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1995 clauses 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 14 , 16 , 19 to 23 , and 26 to 29 were agreed to . clauses 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 18 , 24 and 25 secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr chairman , i move that the clauses specified be amended as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members . clause 2 ( e ) is amended to clarify the definition of the terms " registration committee " and " specialized works " , and to define the term " supervision plan " as a plan setting out the plan of safety management of building works or street works lodged by the authorized person with the building authority prior to or at the time of application for consent to commence works or as a result of carrying out urgent works . clause 4 (2) , (3) , (4) and (5) are deleted , and substituted by the new clause 4 (2) to : ( a ) establish two panels with sufficient members from whom the building authority may appoint more than one authorized persons registration committee or a registered structural engineers registration committee at the same time ; ( b ) set out the functions of the registration committee ; ( c ) change the quorum for a meeting of the authorized persons registration committee from six to five , and that of the registered structural engineers registration committee from five to four ; ( d ) allow the building authority to invite such bodies as he may think fit to nominate persons for his consideration for appointment to each of the respective registration committees ; and ( e ) empower the building authority to direct the registration committee to hold meetings in order to prevent any unreasonable delay in the consideration of applications for inclusion in the relevant register . clause 4 (11) is amended to ensure that the registration of an authorized person or structural engineer will continue to be in force despite any delay in the processing of his application for retention in the register . a new clause 4 ( 11a ) is added to require the building authority to inform an authorized person or registered structural engineer before removing the latter 's name from the relevant register . clause 4 (18) is amended to clearly specify that the registration of an authorized person or a structural engineer will cease once his name is removed from the relevant register . a new clause 4 (19) is added to ensure that an applicant is informed by the building authority of the reasons for rejection of his application for inclusion , retention or restoration of name in the relevant register . clause 5 is renumbered as clause 5 (1) and is amended to oblige the chairman of an authorized persons and registered structural engineers disciplinary board to appoint a legal adviser to assist in the conduct of the hearing of the disciplinary proceedings , and to advise the board on points of law that arise during the hearing . clause 7 is amended for several purposes , including establishing a panel of members from whom the building authority may appoint more than one contractors registration committee , setting out the functions of the contractors registration committee , and reducing the number of lay members in the registration committee so as to better effect the principle of self-regulation by the building industry . a new proposed section 3a is added to allow the building authority to direct the contractors registration committee to hold meetings in order to help prevent any unreasonable delay in the consideration of applications for registration . the proposed section 8a (4) ( a ) is amended to ensure a contractor who does not carry out any building works or street works but remains in the building business will not have his name removed from the relevant register . the proposed section 8b is amended to : ( a ) set out the factors which the building authority will consider in deciding whether or not an applicant is suitable to register as a general building contractor or a specialist contractor or both ; ( b ) ensure that only an applicant with the necessary experience and qualification to undertake a particular category of works is allowed to register as a specialist contractor for that category of works ; and ( c ) allow the building authority to take relevant local experience as a substitute for academic or technical qualifications in considering an application for inclusion in the register for general building contractors . under the proposed section 8b , the building authority may refer an application back to the contractors registration committee for reconsideration if he does not agree with the latter 's recommendation . the proposed section 8c is amended to ensure that the registration of a contractor will continue to be in force despite any delay in the processing of the application for inclusion , retention or restoration of his name in the relevant register . the building authority is also required to inform a contractor before removing the latter 's name from the relevant register . a new proposed section 8da is added to ensure an applicant is informed by the building authority of the reasons for rejecting his application for inclusion , retention and restoration of name in the register for general building contractors or specialised contractors . the proposed section 8f is amended to ensure the registration of the existing registered contractors and registered ventilation contractors will continue to be in force for two years after the bill commences unless a disciplinary board orders otherwise . clause 9 (4) is added to oblige the chairman of a contractors disciplinary board to appoint a legal adviser to assist in the conduct of the hearing of the disciplinary proceedings and to advise the board on points of law that arise during the hearing . clause 11 is amended to : ( a ) make deviating in a material manner from the supervision plan , drawing up a supervision plan that does not comply with the material requirements under the buildings ordinance and repeatedly drawing up supervision plans that do not comply with the requirements under the ordinance by registered general building contractors or registered specialist contractors , a misconduct and be subject to investigation of the disciplinary board ; ( b ) empower the disciplinary board to impose a fine not exceeding $250,000 ; and ( c ) remove the power of a judge in dismissing an appeal against a decision of the disciplinary board if he considers no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred , even if he was of the opinion that the point raised in the appeal might have been decided in favour of the appellant . this further protects the rights of appellants . clause 12 is amended to make failure in lodging the supervision plan a ground for the building authority to refuse to give consent to commencement of works . clause 15 is amended to empower the building authority to order works to cease if there is a material deviation from the technical memorandum for the preparation of the supervision plan , which may lead to a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation or if a condition attached to the approval or consent given by the building authority has not been or is not able to be complied with . amendments to clauses 24 and 25 are technical and consequential to the recent authentication of the chinese version of the regulations made under the air pollution control ordinance . mr chairman , i beg to move . ( a ) in proposed section 13 (1) , by deleting " that a registered general building contractor or a registered specialist contractor has been convicted by a court of such an offence , or has in the carrying out of building works or street works been guilty of such negligence or misconduct , as " and substituting " the matters set out in subsection ( 1a ) in relation to a registered general building contractor or a registered specialist contractor if the conduct referred to the disciplinary board may " . question on the amendments proposed , put and agreed to . question on clauses 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 18 , 24 and 25 , as amended , put and agreed to . clause 17 secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr chairman , i move the amendments proposed in paragraphs ( a ) and ( b ) of my amendments to clause 17 as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members , so that the authorized persons , registered structural engineers , registered general building contractors and registered specialist contractors will not be criminally liable for failure to supervise in the prescribed manner . after lengthy discussion with the professional institutes and in the bills committee , the administration believes that there should be a three - tier sanctions system . minor deviations from the supervision plan should attract administrative warnings . more serious deviations or repeated minor deviations should attract disciplinary proceedings . criminal sanctions should only apply when works were carried out contrary to a supervision plan to the extent that the contravention constitutes a material deviation from the plan resulting directly in injury to persons , damage to property or a risk of injury or damage . after members have agreed to the deletion , i will move amendments to give effect to the administration 's intention . mr chairman , i beg to move . proposed amendment clause 17 that clause 17 be amended �0�0 ( a ) by deleting subclause (2) ( a ) . question on the amendment proposed . mr ronald arculli : mr chairman , i just want to briefly remind members of the slightly complicated clause 17 . the motion by the secretary for planning , environment and lands to delete subclauses 2 ( a ) and 2 ( c ) of the existing clause 17 , as he says quite rightly , simply removes what was the original suggestion in terms of the criminal sanction . so , i would urge members to support the deletion of those two paragraphs . in terms of the amendment to be proposed by the honourable edward ho , that is simply a tidying up exercise in terms of deletion of the existing clause 17 (3) ( b ) in the present bill . that should really go along with subclause 2 ( a ) and subclause 2 ( c ) . the administration will later introduce a further amendment to bring in a different form of criminal sanction . the form of criminal sanction as it stands in the bill , therefore , will not be very sensible or operative , in fact , with all the other amendments that have actually gone through . so members should actually support the secretary for planning , environment and lands in his present motion and support mr edward ho in his motion to delete clause 17 (3) ( b ) and vote against the secretary for planning , environment and lands when he introduces the new criminal sanction if they are not minded to support criminal sanctions . thank you , mr chairman . mr albert chan : mr chairman , the democratic party supports the amendment moved by the government in respect of clauses 17 ( a ) and 17 ( b ) . clause 17 ( c ) , which relates to criminal liability and is more controversial , will be dealt with later . as far as 17 ( a ) and 17 ( b ) are concerned , we support the government 's proposals . question on the amendment put and agreed to . mr edward ho : mr chairman , i move that clause 17 be further amended as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members , and i would like to thank the honourable ronald arcilli for explaining to members the technical nature of this particular amendment , and i think on this one , the administration actually agrees with my amendment . so , for those members who wish to make a decision on the question of criminal sanction , it will be a little bit later , when the secretary for planning , environment and lands moves his amendment under paragraph ( c ) , and i will also speak on that subject at that time . thank you . proposed amendment clause 17 that clause 17 be further amended , by deleting subclause (3) ( b ) . question on the amendment proposed . secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr chairman , the administration supports the committee stage amendment moved by the honourable edward ho . question on the amendment put and agreed to . secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr chairman , i further move the amendment proposed in paragraph ( c ) of my amendments to clause 17 as set out under my name in the paper circularized to members , so that the carrying out of works contrary to a supervision plan to the extent that the contravention constitutes a material deviation from the supervision plan , resulting directly in injury to persons or damage to property or a risk of injury or damage will be a criminal offence . on conviction , the maximum penalty is a fine of $250,000 plus imprisonment for three years . the proposed offence is necessary to deter failure in providing proper supervision which is essential to site safety . to allow both the industry and the government to gain experience with the new system , provisions relating to criminal offences will come into effect one year after the commencement of the bill . mr chairman , i beg to move . proposed amendment that clause 17 be further amended , by adding �0�0 " (6) section 40 is amended by adding - " ( 2ba ) any person directly concerned with building works or street works who - ( a ) carries out building works or street works , or authorizes or permits building works or street works to be carried out contrary to a supervision plan to the extent that the contravention constitutes a material deviation from the supervision plan and as a direct result injury to any person or damage to any property occurs ; or ( b ) carries out building works or street works , or authorizes or permits building works or street works to be carried out contrary to a supervision plan to the extent that the contravention constitutes a material deviation from the supervision plan and as a direct result injury to any person or damage to any property is likely to occur , is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of $250,000 and to imprisonment for 3 years . " . " . question on the amendment proposed . mr edward ho : mr chairman , i should state at the outset that it is the unanimous decision of the bills committee formed to study the buildings ( amendment ) ( no . 3 ) bill 1995 that the provision regarding criminal sanction should be deleted , and i am sure that this time no one will challenge me on that because the written report by the chairman of the house committee , mr ronald arculli , has been fully discussed in the bills committee . the bills committee has had intensive and extensive discussion on the merits of applying criminal sanction to persons engaged in the building industry . there is no dispute that safety at construction sites should be improved but both members of the bills committee and the professional institutions cannot agree with the administration that criminal sanction is the right way to do it . it is worth to note that under the existing provision of the buildings ordinance , any person , including authorized persons , registered structural engineers and registered contractors , who allows the carrying out of building works in such a manner as to cause injury or risk of injury to any person or damage to any property is liable on conviction to imprisonment for three years . so , it is there already . under the common law , the building professionals will be liable as a professional person if they are found to be negligent . the professionals will face various consequences for professional negligence that causes an accident . apart from that , professionals will have to compensate for any loss incurred due to delayed completion of a project under commercial obligations . given that the building professionals are already subject to severe penalty for professional misconduct under the existing system , it is highly doubtful as to how the proposal about criminal sanction will help enhance safety standards at construction sites . i need to point out that the proposed criminal sanction will be applied only to building professionals working for the private sector . public officers and professionals engaged in public projects are exempted and will not be subject to criminal liability . such a disparity in treatment and double standard arrangements can hardly be justified . should the administration 's proposal be enacted , it will discourage building professionals from joining the private sector and dampen the morale of the whole building industry . members may wish to note that to ensure that the building professionals will perform their supervisory duties , the bills committee , the professional institutions and the administration have jointly worked out a proposal on the sanction system to deter deviations from the supervision plans deposited with the building authority and submitting a plan that does not comply with the technical memorandum . under the graduated sanctions system for minor offences , the building authority will give an administrative warning . for more serious offences , the responsible ap , rse or rc will be subject to investigation of the disciplinary board established under the buildings ordinance . the building authority will also be empowered to order works to cease whenever there is a breach of the conditions of consent to commence works , including material deviations from a supervision plan . members of the bills committee are of the view that these measures will have sufficient deterrent effect to ensure the following of supervision plans , coupled with the improvement made to the registration of and disciplinary proceedings for professionals . the bills committee and the professional institutions considered that there is no urgent need to improve criminal sanction at this stage . the need for criminal sanction should be reviewed after the coming into operation of the new bill for a certain period of time . as such , the bills committee arrives at the decision that the clause about criminal sanction should be repealed . with these remarks , mr chairman , i object to the amendment . secretary for planning , environment and lands : mr chairman , the administration recommends a three - tier sanctions system because we believe these different levels of sanctions will provide a flexible and effective system of deterrent against breaches of site safety requirements . the disciplinary procedures will allow the professional bodies and contractors ' association to exercise self-regulation , while criminal prosecution is required to deal with serious breaches . at the early stage , the building authority will , where appropriate , issue warnings instead of initiating disciplinary action . the following reasons have been cited for not supporting any form of criminal sanction : ( a ) the proposed criminal sanction would , in many cases , fall on junior site staff ; ( b ) disciplinary sanctions on the professionals will suffice ; and ( c ) it would be unfair to apply criminal sanction to private sector projects and not to government and housing authority projects . now , in response to the first one , i must point out that site safety requires the joint efforts of all concerned parties , including authorized persons , registered structural engineers , building contractors and the technically - competent persons . the supervision plan , which i agree with the honourable edward ho , is an improvement on the existing system because the supervision plan will set out the duties of the concerned parties and reflect their roles on site . the technical memorandum will set out the circumstances in which a person 's supervision duty may be delegated or assigned to another person . so , all parties ' responsibilities for the site management and safe management of construction works will be clearly set out in the supervision plan . these measures will prevent any abuse , including junior staff being used as scapegoats . as to the second reason , that is , that disciplinary sanctions would be enough because we are dealing with professionals , the administration does not agree that disciplinary sanction is sufficient nor appropriate in the case of serious deviation from the supervision plan . we do not see why a person should be exempted from criminal liability when his fault directly causes death or injury or damage to property or danger to the public . under the existing buildings ordinance , many less serious offences already entail criminal sanction . for example , a person is currently criminally liable for material deviation from the approved building plan , whether or not injury or danger is caused . moreover , disciplinary proceedings are not applicable to all people engaged in building works . there is therefore a vacuum in the system where those responsible for supervising or executing certain works are not subject to sufficient sanctions for non-compliance with the supervision plan . as regards the third reason , that is , while the private sector engineers and authorized persons may be liable while the government architects and engineers are not , the administration has clearly stated at the bills committee that it is willing to look into the matter of extending the scope of the buildings ordinance to cover public sector projects , so we are willing to act , but it is only a question of time . why time ? members will appreciate that the existing dual control system of building works , one for private sector and one for the public sector , has been in place for decades , many , many years . to apply the buildings ordinance to public sector projects will entail far - reaching policy and resource implications . the procedures and organization structures and the division of responsibility among many government departments will need major changes . furthermore , we need to consider the implication on civil servants ' immunity to criminal liability in the course of performing public duties . all these are very complex issues and must be thoroughly considered first . we will examine the matters expeditiously and discuss it with this council 's planning , lands and works panel . in 1995 , the overall accident rate in private sector projects is three to four times higher than that in government projects . some claim that such statistics are misleading , but they have failed to substantiate their claim . the safety record of government and housing authority projects is far better than that of the private sector projects . while the administration is not complacent with its own performance and agrees that there is still room for further improvement , the significant difference in the accident rate does indicate that the improvement of safety control in private sector projects is an urgent matter and should be tackled first . this is the reason for the timing , and this is the principal aim of the bill . members should not be side - tracked by the proposal to extend the scope of the buildings ordinance which the administration will , as i said , consider in depth and intends to come up with a recommendation on the way forward . the administration firmly believes that the three - tier sanctions system is reasonable and workable and necessary for safety assurance . the public is concerned with the high accident rate in building projects and hope that tighter and effective sanctions could be provided so as to improve the situation . i therefore look forward to members ' support for the administration 's committee stage amendments . thank you , mr chairman . question on the secretary for planning , environment and lands 's further amendment to clause 17 put . voice vote taken . the chairman said he thought the " noes " had it . mr lee cheuk - yan claimed a division . chairman : committee shall proceed to a division . chairman : members may wish to be reminded that they are now called upon to vote on the question that the amendments proposed in paragraph ( c ) of the secretary for planning , environment and lands 's amendments to clause 17 be approved . will members please register their presence by pressing the top button and then proceed to vote by choosing one of the three buttons below ? chairman : we are still three short of the head count . will members please check their votes ? are there any queries ? the result will now be displayed . mr lee cheuk -

" mrs selina chow : mr president , i move the motion standing in my name on the order paper . the motion seeks to repeal the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 . a subcommittee , chaired by me , was formed on 7 june 1996 to study this regulation . it has held two meetings with the administration and met representatives of the federation of hong kong hotel owners limited and the tourist guest houses federation of hong kong limited . having carefully studied the proposed structure of the revised scale of fees and heard the views of the deputations , the subcommittee decides that the regulation should be repealed . it is concerned about the substantial increase in licence fees , particularly for hotels , and the unfair structure of the revised scale of fees . in the administration 's proposed scale of fees comprising 10 bands ( instead of the existing six ) , there are substantial increases in licence fees for all bands , except for the one on " one to five rooms " ( that is , holiday flats ) . the increase is particularly steep for the band of " over 500 rooms " ( that is , large hotels ) , with an 11 - fold increase over the existing fee , phased over three years . according to the licensing authority about 20% of the hotels started operation after the licensing system came into effect in 1991 . these hotels would have complied fully with all the statutory requirements . yet they are the establishments which will have to shoulder the largest proportion of licensing costs and face the stiffest jumps in fees . members of the subcommittee consider the government 's adoption of room numbers as the sole factor in the computation of licence fees as unfair to the licensees . the total licensing costs for each hotel / guesthouse should be determined on an individual basis according to its own circumstances , taking into account the facilities in each establishment . moreover , we have doubts about the operating costs in the enforcement of the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ordinance since there is probably a duplication of work between the licensing teams and the policing / prosecuting teams . the federation of hong kong hotel owners limited is concerned that the substantial increase in licence fees would add to the already high operating costs of hotels , thereby jeopardizing the development of the hotel industry . it has pointed out that apart from complying with the conditions of the hotel licence , hotel operators had to fulfil various licensing requirements pertaining to the different ancillary facilities in the hotel , such as the ballroom , swimming pool , shopping arcade and so on ( some hotel operators need to obtain over 20 licences ) . moreover , hotels are levied a 5% accommodation tax . the federation thinks that since hotels and guesthouses are different in nature , they should therefore be treated differently . in sum , the hotel industry feels that it is unfair to make the industry shoulder the substantial share of the licensing cost . the federation is also of the opinion that the proposed scale of fees is not fair to law - abiding hotel proprietors in that they have to bear the huge cost involved in the licensing of thousands of unlicensed guesthouses , clubs and holiday flats . the tourist guest houses federation of hong kong limited is opposed to the new schedule of licence fees by reason of the administration 's inaction towards unlicensed guesthouses and its questionable approach in the computation of licence fees . subcommittee members share the views of the two federations . we also have reservations about the present licensing system and submit that there should be a review of the policy . we consider that the fees for the first issue of a licence should be different from that for the renewal of a licence . we think that the administration should look into the feasibility of issuing a " comprehensive " licence covering the operation of all facilities in a hotel . this would avoid duplication of work , hence a waste of resources by various government departments , so that hotels would be spared the double payment of costs . moreover , the issuance of this kind of licence could save the trouble and possible confusion for hotel operators by relieving them of the need to deal with different departments at different times . the administration explained that , in devising the proposed scale of fees , the costs of policing and the prosecution of illegal operators have not been taken into account , so there is no question of licensed establishments subsidizing unlicensed ones ; or of the hotel industry subsidizing the guesthouse industry and vice versa . in view of the industry 's opinion regarding the cumbersome procedures involved in the application for the various licences required under the present system , the administration is looking into the feasibility of issuing a " comprehensive " licence . the subcommittee is unconvinced of the administration 's arguments on the computation of the revised scale of fees , and therefore cannot support the proposed regulation . mr president , i move this motion on account of the above reasons . mr president , i have already made a report on the work of the subcommittee in the capacity of its chairman and now i would like to speak on the views of the liberal party . the government 's proposed hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 on the adjustment of the licence fees for hotels and guesthouses has aroused an uproar in the industry . as pointed out earlier in the report submitted by me as chairman of the subcommittee , the proposed licence fees of most bands of the establishments involve substantial increases , with the three - year accumulated increase for one of the bands coming to as high as 11 times over its existing fees . in my opinion , the most ideal arrangement is to repeal the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 as proposed by the subcommittee . but the only undesirable effect of such repeal is that the possible reduction in the licence fee for holiday flats having one to five rooms as proposed in the regulation may thus be scrapped . if the government wishes to raise the fees , it has to provide more detailed information and convincing arguments , and put forward another proposed scale of fees which has taken into account the impact on the operating conditions of the industry for scrutiny by this council . i believe that if the government is willing to minimize the operating costs , eliminate unnecessary waste of resources and devise a reasonable way of fee computation , it will then be considered treating the matter in a responsible and practical way , showing concern for our industrial and commercial operations . it is a pity that the subcommittee 's proposal of repealing the government 's proposed regulation has not gained full support from the democratic party . they want to amend the regulation so that guesthouses having five rooms or less can get a reduction in fees while the other establishments will see discretional increases in licence fees at a rate lower than that proposed by the government . the liberal party has consulted the representatives of the federation of hong kong hotel owners limited and other people in the industry . they all think that as long as the increase does not exceed the inflation rate , it will be reluctantly accepted . we therefore relayed this opinion clearly to the democratic party , and are glad that the honourable sin chung - kai has accepted the opinion in the end and put forward a final amendment acceptable to the industry , proposing rates of increase lower than that originally contemplated by the democratic party . i want to clarify that although the liberal party agrees to the amended increases , it does not indicate that we agree to the government 's unreasonable fees policy . i would also like to take this chance to request the home affairs branch , which is in charge of this matter , to conduct an in - depth review so as to formulate a reasonable and cost - effective licensing and licence renewal policy . we support the government 's principle of cost recovery , but many recent incidents made us see that it has been , to a certain degree , abused by the government . government officials have regarded this principle as a golden rule . in order to fully recover the costs as soon as possible , they would resort to exorbitant fee increases in disregard of the impacts on the industries concerned . thus , there was the excessive increase of over 10 times within three years in the original proposal on the fees for hotels and guesthouses . we think that the realization of a principle cannot succeed if it is out of touch with the ability of the people and the industrial and commercial operations to cope with it . the fact that the government has time and again repeated the same mistake only reflects its failure to learn from past mistakes , still clinging on to its die - hard bureaucratic attitude . we do not understand why the government is so anxious to recover all the costs in just a few years . why can we not achieve the same goal over a longer period of time ? an ossified government and indifferent bureaucracy will only arouse public protests and affect the government 's integrity and credibility . it may even unnecessarily stir up social unrest and confrontation . what good will it do to our society ? question on the motion proposed . president : mr sin chung - kai has also given notice to move a motion under the interpretation and general clauses ordinance to amend the same regulation , that is , the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 . mr sin chung - kai 's motion has been printed in the annex to the order paper . as the contents of mrs chow 's and mr sin 's motions relate to the same subject , the two motions are cognate . i propose to have them debated together in a joint debate . the two motions shall now be debated together in a joint debate . members may now speak on either or both of the motions . at the end of the debate , we will first vote on mrs selina chow 's motion . if mrs selina chow 's motion is agreed , that will by implication mean that mr sin chung - kai 's motion is not approved . if mrs chow 's motion is not carried , mr sin chung - kai will be called upon to move his motion , but the question on mr sin 's motion will be put without further debate . mr sin chung - kai , you may speak on both your motion and mrs selina chow 's motion but you are not to move your motion yet . mr sin chung - kai : mr president , first of all , i must thank you for granting me leave to move this amendment . i should also thank the honourable mrs selina chow for chairing the subcommittee and enabling the subcommittee to obtain an in - depth understanding of the situation of the industry . in the meantime , i must also apologize to members for proposing this amendment only after the last meeting of the subcommittee . i believe that had i been able to propose it in the subcommittee , the amendment would have gained the support of the subcommittee as well . my amendment consists of three main points . first , to maintain the proposal of the government that the fees for guesthouses with one to five rooms should be reduced to $2,800 ; second , the fees for hotels and guesthouses with six to 100 rooms are to remain at the existing level ; and third , the fees for hotels and guesthouses with over 100 rooms are to be adjusted by the total inflation rate ( which is about 18% ) of a period of 26 months covering the years 1995 and 1996 . let me explain my rationale . in the first place , the democratic party supports the views of the subcommittee as presented in the questions raised by mrs selina chow earlier in respect of the regulation itself and the licensing system . for instance , the fees for the first issue of a licence and those for renewal should not be the same , nor should the fees for hotels and guesthouses be put on a par . furthermore , the calculation of fees should not be based simply on the number of rooms . therefore , we urge the government to review afresh the whole licensing system and the computation method for the cost , and so set the cost at a reasonable level . i would not dwell on this point because mrs selina chow has already given a detailed account in this respect . this proposal of the democratic party ultimately seeks to enable persons who own or use " holiday flats " with one to five rooms to benefit from the fee reduction as soon as possible while , at the same time , the loss incurred in the reduction can be recovered from hotels and guesthouses with over 100 rooms . the amendment proposed by the democratic party is not meant to be an opposition against the government 's principle of cost recovery . however , the democratic party thinks that the government should set its timetable for cost recovery in the light of the burden on businesses . in fact , it normally takes three to five years for the government to recover the cost . now that the government wants to recover the cost within the shortest possible time of three years , the fees have thus soared substantially . in this particular case , the rates of increase to recover the cost range from 30% to 300%. the democratic party hopes that the government would listen to the views of the subcommittee and review afresh the whole licensing system and charging policy . lastly , i would like to echo the views of mrs selina chow and hope that members will accept my amendment . thank you , mr president . mr chan wing - chan : mr president , i am one of the members of the subcommittee to study the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 . the new licensing fees , as set out by the government , have gone up substantially for all types of hotels and guesthouses except for those holiday houses " with one to five rooms " . in particular , large hotels with more than 500 rooms will need to pay licensing fees which will , over a period of three years , be increased to 11 times their present fees . mr president , hefty increase in licensing fees for hotels and guesthouses would mean a heavy burden on the hotel industry and increased operating costs , thereby threatening the operations of the hotel industry . this does not help in increasing job opportunities , and the subcommittee objected to the increase . now the honourable sin chung - kai from the democratic party has put forward an amendment containing three parts : (1) licensing fees for guesthouses with one to five rooms may be reduced ; (2) licensing fees for hotels and guesthouses with six to 100 rooms should be frozen ; and (3) licensing fees for hotels with 101 to 500 rooms or more should be increased according to inflation . i am not sure whether the democratic party 's amendment is meant to allow the government to collect some revenue as indeed the government has failed in its recent attempts to increase charges . if this amendment is passed , the government should thank the democratic party for its good intentions . as the member representing the hotels and catering functional constituency , i find , after studying the amendment , that it may ease the burden on some of the hotel operators . in addition , the federation of hong kong hotel owners limited has indicated , on being consulted , that the amendment can be accepted " with reluctance " . so , the hong kong federation of trade unions , the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong and i will vote for the amendment . however , i must point out that in future when the government put forward proposals for fee increases , it should not set the rates of increase at will . nor should it propose huge or unreasonable increases , because the government may not be as lucky as it is this time . mr president , these are my remarks . mr frederick fung : mr president , regarding this motion , i basically support the honourable sin chung - kai 's amendment . despite that , there are still several points i would like to mention . in principle , i am for the government 's proposal to recover the cost from the licensing of hotels and guesthouses . however , in the course of studying the regulation , we have discovered that there are a lot of technical problems . hence , we have so much reservation that we cannot agree with the present proposal . one of the problems involves the time allowed for cost recovery , which is as short as three years . naturally , this would greatly boost the rate of increase . we are thus concerned that this would affect the operators in the industry . secondly , the way licences are issued . at present , licences are issued annually . we are concerned that suppose the administration makes a lot of suggestions for maintenance and improvement in respect of a guesthouse or hotel , yet the maintenance or improvement work completed this year normally would not just break down or become ruined the following year such that the administration would have to inspect the premises again . does it mean that in the following year , the administration will have to use the same amount of manpower and the same amount of time to deal with the same case again ? and does it mean that the same or even a higher licence fee will have to be recovered ? so , i think the way licences are issued is problematic . thirdly , the method of calculation for licence fees . the hong kong association for democracy and people 's livelihood and i find that in fact the licence fees may in certain ways overlap with the other licences hotels and guesthouses need to obtain . one example is fire safety . the licensing authority of course has to make an inspection , but the fire services department has to do that too . as another example , when issuing licences for restaurants in hotels and guesthouses , the licensing authority certainly has to make an inspection , but the urban council has to do that as well . that is why we think that the government should take these duplications into account and reconsider the method of calculation of the licence fees . to summarize , indeed we are agreeable both to the motion moved by the honourable mrs selina chow and that moved by mr sin chung - kai . the reason for this lies not in choosing between stopping the government from making any increase in fees or minimizing such increases , but in forcing the government to produce a method of calculation that we think is appropriate and reasonable . we support mr sin chung - kai 's motion today mainly because we hope the government can put forward a way to review the licence fees as soon as possible . thank you , mr president . mr howard young : mr president , hotels constitute a significant part of the tourism industry . each year , there are 10 million tourists visiting hong kong and close to a quarter of the money they spent is on hotel accommodation . as the representative of the tourism industry , i would like to give my views on the proposed amendments to the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 . to begin with , the people working in the tourism industry and the hotel industry are very grateful to members from the association for democracy and people 's livelihood , the liberal party , the democratic party and the hong kong federation of trade unions for making a concerted effort in response to this fee increase proposed by the government . that said , this does not mean that people in the hotel industry do not accept the principle of " user pays " . they feel aggrieved because behind this principle , there are many things which they believe to be unfair and inappropriate . since the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ordinance was enacted in the legislative council five years ago , the hotel industry , particularly the federation of hong kong hotel owners limited , has held a number of meetings with the government and made submissions regarding the many highly inequitable areas therein concerning its operation and standard . the hotel industry is an enormous industry which requires copious investment . without the hotel industry , it would be very difficult for the other sectors in the hong kong tourism industry to grow . the hotel industry has consistently held that the government should encourage more investments in hotels for this will be beneficial to the overall economy as well as the employment situation of hong kong . indeed , we recognize that the government has , in recent years , taken certain actions to address the issue such as the revision of the plot ratio last year . the plot ratio for hotels , which was previously assessed on the basis of residential property , is now assessed on the basis of commercial property . on the other hand , the government has nonetheless withdrawn certain preferential treatment . so in the end , some hotels do not think that the government has done much help to them . in this year 's budget , the financial secretary has proposed new methods of calculation with regard to certain hotel facilities , such as tax credits for renovation projects . this is certainly encouraging . in this connection , we admit that the government has done something but on the other hand , over the years the hotel industry has been pointing out that the licensing system warrants an earnest improvement . for instance , while it is understandable that stringent inspection should be conducted prior to the opening or during the construction of a hotel , people in the hotel industry have consistently advocated that after a hotel is issued a licence , the hotel should not be required to go through new rounds of inspection or tests which are very stringent or even based on a revised set of standards every year before it is allowed to renew its licence . the case should be compared to a learner driver who has passed the test and been issued a driving licence . obviously , driving a vehicle is very different from building a hotel but , given the fact that the government now has had three bills in relation to the licensing system tabled in the legislative council pending deliberation by the bills committees to be convened , it is our hope that in the meetings to discuss these bills the government will consider ways to make the licensing system operate in a fairer and more efficient manner , thereby avoiding a substantial increase in the fees . therefore , in my view , this amendment which proposes an increase in fees provisionally pegged to inflation and a reduction in fees for small guesthouses can basically be an expedient measure to allow the government more time to study how the charging system can be reviewed thoroughly . this should , in the long run , achieve the aim of " user pays " and , on the other hand , encourage investors to invest in the hotel industry or the tourism industry . thank you , mr president . president : does any more member wish to speak ? if not , i will give leave for mr sin chung - kai to speak for the second time as he will not be given the opportunity to speak after the conclusion of the joint debate . mr sin chung - kai : i call upon my honourable colleagues to vote against the motion moved by the honourable mrs selina chow and then support my motion later on . in fact , our objectives are the same , that is , we both hope that the government can review the system . i am sorry , mrs selina chow , that i have to ask members to negative your motion and then support my motion . thank you . president : mr sin chung - kai , you are not supposed to address other members . you should only address the president . secretary for home affairs : mr president , i urge honourable members not to repeal the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 and not to support the proposed amendments to the regulation as moved by the honourable sin chung - kai . the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ordinance was enacted in may 1991 to provide for a licensing scheme to regulate fire and building safety , health and hygiene of hotel and guesthouse accommodation . under the ordinance , any person operating a hotel or guesthouse is required to obtain a certificate of exemption or a licence . as the purpose of the ordinance is to regulate the safety of temporary accommodation for tourists and local people , both hotels and guesthouses are subject to the licensing scheme . annual inspections are essential before licence renewal to ensure that the premises continue to comply with the licence conditions . the vigorous enforcement of the ordinance by the licensing authority has contributed to the reputation of our hotels and guesthouses in the context of safety . the licensing authority has taken , and will continue to take , robust enforcement actions against unlicensed establishments . i should stress that there is no duplication of work between the licensing authority and other government departments , as the licensing authority is the one and only agency in the administration responsible for the licensing of hotels and guesthouses . it is government policy that fees should in general be set at levels sufficient to recover the full cost of providing the services from the users . this is an important principle which forms an integral part of our revenue structure and which underpins our low tax economy . the public accounts committee in 1994 recommended that the secretary for home affairs should devise an action plan as soon as possible to achieve full cost recovery for the licensing of hotels and guesthouses . our proposed fee scale for licensing hotels and guesthouses seeks to reflect the costs of licensing establishments of different sizes more accurately . the proposed scale is more equitable than the existing scale to operators of small guesthouses / holiday flats . over 600 such establishments will enjoy a 31% reduction in licence fees under the proposed scale . the cost of operating the licensing scheme is $20.6 million per annum . under the existing fee scale , we only recover about $9 million or 43% of the cost if all establishments are licensed . although our proposal seeks to achieve full cost recovery over three years , in the first year , the cost recovery is only about 70%, which means taxpayers are still subsidizing the hotel / guesthouse business by about $6 million . i wish to stress that the regulation has little , if any , impact on livelihood and no inflation as local customers account for a very small share of the business turnover of hotels and guesthouses . the proposed fee increases would only have a very mild impact on the operating costs of the industry . i urge honourable members not to repeal the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 , otherwise , our taxpayers will have to continue to subsidize hotels and guesthouses , which are private , profit - making and non-welfare organizations . clearly , this is against the " user pays " principle and is unreasonable and unfair . the repeal would run counter to the public accounts committee 's recommendation and prevent the administration from rationalizing the fee structure . i further urge honourable members not to resolve to amend the regulation as moved by the honourable sin chung - kai . the fee scale under the resolution has little , if any , regard to full cost recovery . neither could it implement the recommendation of the public accounts committee . it would prevent the administration from rationalizing the fee structure and cause unacceptable delay in achieving full cost recovery . under this resolution , if passed , our taxpayers would continue to subsidize hotels and guesthouses , which i reiterate is unreasonable and unfair . thank you , mr president . mrs selina chow : through you , mr president , i would like to tell the honourable sin chung - kai that there is no need to say sorry . it is a very great merit that he is aware of his own mistake and makes an attempt to correct it . ( laughter ) but be early next time . as chairman of the subcommittee , actually i have no other alternative but to act according to the decision of the subcommittee . it has already been mentioned a moment ago that although the repeal of the regulation can freeze the charges , the holiday flats cannot have the benefit of a reduction in fees . besides , in view of the new development after the last meeting of the subcommittee and in order to arrive at a scenario that is acceptable to all parties , the liberal party will follow the idea of the secretary for home affairs by not supporting the motion of the subcommittee but will have to run counter to the secretary 's idea by supporting the motion moved by mr sin chung - kai . question on mrs selina chow 's motion put and negatived . president : now that mrs selina chow 's motion has been negatived , i will call upon mr sin chung - kai to move his motion . mr sin chung - kai to move the following motion : " that the hotel and guesthouse accommodation ( fees ) ( amendment ) regulation 1996 , published as legal notice no . 224 of 1996 and laid on the table of the legislative council on 5 june 1996 , be amended in paragraph 3 of the amendment regulation by repealing everything after " 2,800 " and substituting �0�0 mr sin chung - kai : mr president , i move that the motion standing in my name on the order paper be approved . question on the motion proposed , put and agreed to . president : i have accepted the recommendations of the house committee as to the time limits on speeches for the motion debates and members were informed by circular on 8 july . the movers of the motions will each have 15 minutes for their speeches including their replies , and another five minutes to speak on the proposed amendments , where applicable . other members , including the movers of the amendments , will each have seven minutes for their speeches . under standing order 27a , i am obliged to direct any member speaking in excess of the specified time to discontinue his speech . review of sewage services trading fund dr john tse to move the following motion : " that this council urges the government to immediately review the sewage services trading fund ( the fund ) with a view to abolishing the target of full - cost recovery by the year 2000 , extending the period in which to achieve a balanced budget , as well as injecting capital into the fund ; and that , before completion of the review , the government must freeze sewage charges and trade effluent surcharges to avoid increasing the burden on the public and the industrial and commercial sectors , and also streamline the existing appeal procedures for trade effluent surcharges , so as to reduce the costs borne by the appellants . " dr john tse : mr president , i move the motion standing in my name on the order paper . mr president , last week this council negatived the government 's proposal to increase the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharge ( tes ) . in view of such , the government has recently proposed a new charging scheme , with the cost recovery period of the sewage services trading fund ( sstf ) extended to 2005 . the democratic party should have welcomed this attempt by the government to turn right from wrong . however , it is a pity that the government failed to " turn right " completely . the new charging scheme is but an upholstered old sofa . and it is even worse and more expensive than the old scheme . although there is now a longer period of time to recover the cost , the problem is that the heavy burden of the sewage charges would still be shouldered solely by the public . 1. the new scheme is " hiding the litter under a carpet " according to the government 's new proposal , although the cost recovery period of the trading fund is to be extended to the year 2005 , the annual rate of increase in the sewage charges would be as high as 20%. it is because the extended cost recovery period would cause the deficit balance to accumulate . by 2005 , the sewage charges per unit of water would be increased to $5.16 , representing an accumulative rate of increase of as high as 330%. this is even more expensive than what would be $4.47 in the old scheme . the democratic party opines that the present rate of $1.2 per unit of water is high enough , and to increase that to $5.16 is simply unacceptable . the cost - effectiveness of the trading fund is thus questionable . as such , the democratic party is strongly against the 20% annual rate of increase proposed by the government . it should also be noted that the proposed charging scheme is not at all full and accurate , for the operating costs of the second , third and fourth stages of the sewage disposal scheme have not been taken into account . when these stages are due for completion , the rate of increase would be even more drastic . undoubtedly , this arrangement is just " hiding the litter under a carpet " . it seems to be able to accommodate the wishes of both of the public and the legislative council as no injection of capital is required and the sewage charges would not soar immediately . but in reality , the burden of the sewage charges shouldered by the public will not be alleviated . the democratic party believes that in order to solve the problem effectively , apart from extending the cost recovery period , the government should also inject capital into the sstf . 2. refusal to inject capital would lead to serious consequences the democratic party is disappointed and baffled by the government 's refusal to inject capital . the consequences of such a refusal could be very serious because the sstf would only be left with three ways to take on the responsibility for its own profits or losses . one way is to abolish the sstf altogether . i believe nobody would like to see this happen . another one is to reduce the sewage services . yet this would be contrary to the objective to improve the environment of hong kong as promised by the sstf . the last one is to raise the sewage charges drastically . however , in view of our recessionary economy and high unemployment , such a move would put further burden on the public and affect their livelihood seriously . as a matter of fact , there is a huge surplus in the government and it is estimated that the financial reserves would reach $150 billion by 1997 . nevertheless , the government would still levy high rates of sewage charges through the sstf . it is indeed " merciless " and " cares nothing about its people " . 3. request for capital injection is not in breach of the " polluter pays " principle mr president , the government keeps saying that to inject capital into the sstf would violate the " polluter pays " principle . yet to adhere to this principle does not necessarily mean full cost recovery . take the university tuition fee as an example , to adhere to the " user pays " principle does not imply that university students are required to pay the full cost for their education . how many students could really afford to pay the cost of $200,000 a year ? moreover , as drainage works are public facilities , it is indeed the government 's responsibility to undertake these works . it was disclosed at the meeting of the public works subcommittee held this morning that the government would set aside $300 million public expenditure for the dredging projects to be carried out at the rambler channel as well as along the incoming and outgoing sea routes . however , for dredging projects concerning drainage services and the maintenance of sewage ducts , the cost would be borne by the hong kong people . as there exist double standards for the same type of projects , it is just natural for people to suspect that the government is making use of the sstf to shirk its responsibilities . as a matter of fact , the government had , in the past , allocated funds to the drainage services department for the purposes of sewage disposal and sewage collection . for the financial year 1994-95 alone , the fund allocated amounted to $600 million . however , since the introduction of the sewage charges , the government has stopped making such recurrent expenditure . in view of such , the democratic party urges the government to undertake the basic commitment and at least continue to inject the appropriation concerned into the sstf . it should shoulder the responsibility together with the people so as to alleviate people 's burden . 4. notion of environmental protection is over - simplified and awareness of environmental protection is neglected the government has over - simplified the notion of " the polluter pays " in environmental protection into an accounting concept of cost recovery , thus causing the sstf to focus mainly on cost recovery . the major target �0�0 to improve the environment and to enhance people 's awareness of environmental protection �0�0 has been neglected as a result . this is another issue that should be reviewed . though sewage charges have been imposed , the government has never introduced any measures to enhance people 's awareness of environmental protection , nor to strengthen people 's efforts in this respect . such being the case , the sewage charges are introduced for the sake of charging only , and the original purpose to motivate people to better protect the environment has yet to be achieved . indeed , even after the introduction of the sewage charges , people have not cut down on their water consumption . it is therefore very obvious that the introduction of or even any increase in the sewage charges is by no means the only or the most effective way to solve the problem . 5. the operation of the sstf is not transparent enough the sstf has used " to take on the responsibility for its own profits or losses " as its reason for increasing the rates of sewage charges . however , since there is a serious lack of transparency in its function , the general public can hardly monitor its operation . nor can they check whether it is controlling the costs properly and making good use of its resources . as the fund is operating behind closed doors , doubts concerning its cost effectiveness inevitably arise . people would also query whether the government is using environmental protection as a pretext to increase its revenue . 6. the sstf is not as effective as it claims what is even more disappointing is that the water quality in hong kong has not improved at all after people have paid the sewage charges . in 1990 , there were only 10 beaches classified as " poor " and " very poor " . however , in 1995 , instead of falling , the figure has risen to 19 . what is even worse is that 80% of the sewage collected each day is discharged directly into the sea without undergoing any treatment . in addition , about one million cubic metres of uncollected sewage is allowed to flow automatically into the victoria harbour each day . being uncollected , such sewage is naturally untreated as well . the people of hong kong have paid their dues , yet the government has failed to deliver the results . how could such a trading fund , which is not as effective as it claims , be able to " improve the quality of service " ? 7. incorrect estimation of revenue from the trade effluent surcharge without enough understanding of the demand and supply situation concerning the tes , there is no way for the government to improve the rate of return . it was estimated that the revenue for the period immediately after the establishment of the sstf would amount to $270 million . however , as water control zones continued to expand and as most of the affected users tried to avoid paying the tes by using less water , the actual revenue was $70 million only . according to the figures from the drainage services department , the tes revenue had dropped from $108 million between april and september 1995 to $69 million in the first quarter of 1996 . all these figures reflect that something is wrong with the basic operation of the sstf . 8. the existing complaint system is too complicated the government has indicated that if business operators believe that the strength of their effluent has been over - estimated , or that the government has made an incorrect estimation of their rates of effluent discharge , they can appeal to the departments concerned . but it has also been specified that the appellants must hire authorized laboratories to test the sewage samples collected regularly . however , the cost involved would usually be $20,000 to $30,000 , thus rendering the cost of an appeal higher than the overcharged tes . such being the case , how many business operators would try to appeal ? moreover , many business operators have found the existing complaint system too complicated . out of the 10 000 tes bills issued in the first quarter of 1996 , only 89 complaints have been received . in view of such , the democratic party urges the government to simplify the procedures and reduce the cost involved in making appeals as soon as possible . in so doing , more business operators will be able to appeal to the government when they have doubts over the charges , thereby avoiding any inappropriate sewage charges and tes . all in all , the democratic party believes that it is now the right time to conduct a comprehensive review of the sstf . the original objectives of the sstf were : (1) to improve the quality of service ; (2) to monitor the operation of the fund and make it more transparent ; and (3) to enhance the flexibility in the use of resources . although the sstf has been in formal operation for almost a year , it has failed to achieve its objectives . in addition , a large number of problems have emerged . last but not least , the democratic party suggests that the government actively review the operation of the sstf , basically to : (1) extend the period of cost recovery ; (2) inject capital into the fund through interest - free loans ; (3) freeze the sewage charges and the tes before the completion of the review ; (4) simplify the appeal procedures regarding the tes ; and (5) enhance the transparency of the sstf to enable the public to monitor its operation effectively . should the government try to raise the rates of charges drastically before fulfilling the above requests , the democratic party will continue to oppose the raising of charges . mr president , with these remarks , i move the motion . question on the motion proposed . mr henry tang : mr president , the government has told the media recently that it agrees to extend the cost recovery period of the sewage services trading fund from 2000 to 2005 but the annual rate of increase will have to be raised to 20%. the government has also indicated that it will insist on the principle of " polluter pays " and it will not consider injecting capital into the fund . to me , the government 's idea is incomprehensible . i simply cannot understand why the government thinks it possible that we would accept an increase of 20% now after we voted down the increase of 15% last week . there is no way that the liberal party would accept it . i want to ask the government whether it is a joke played on the people that given the current economic downturn , the government is in fact demanding an increase of 20% after bargaining when people cannot even afford an increase of 15%. does the government really believe that members will go against the people 's wishes and accept this proposal that is a far cry from public opinion ? mr president , the government has repeatedly accused the legislative council of paying only lip service in supporting the principle of " polluter pays " . i can tell the government that the legislative council is of course willing to bear the price brought about by the proposal . however , as we represent the public opinion in monitoring the government , every vote that we cast will have to be accountable to the people and it is impossible for us to accept the government 's unreasonable proposals lightly . we are in support of the " polluter pays " principle , but that does not mean that we do not have a bottom line or that we will indiscriminately support any proposal thrown out by the government . otherwise , we will let the people down . mr president , i made a public statement about the stance and recommendations of the liberal party on this proposal last week and i do not intend to repeat today . but i hope that the government will respond to our nine recommendations as soon as possible and tell us whether it accepts them or not and what its arguments are . i also hope that the government will explain to us the detailed figures in support of the need for an annual increase of 20% after extending the cost recovery period to 2005 and tell us the relevant revenues and expenditures when the period is extend to 20 years . the bottom line of the liberal party is that we will not consider supporting any plan that demands an annual increase of more than 10%. the government refuses to inject capital on the ground that it is in breach of the " polluter pays " principle but on the other hand , the government indicates that it has invested large amounts of money in the sewage disposal projects . with regard to that , i am afraid that the government has contradicted itself seriously . on the one hand , the government threatens members that if the government is to inject capital , it may have to raise taxes and rates in order to increase revenue . mr president , we have seen all sorts of threats since we were small and i question what basis the government has to increase taxes and rates . given that there are huge reserves sitting in the treasury , we are only asking the drainage services department to assign the some $400 million , it used to spend on sewage disposal over the past years to the fund . that is perfectly reasonable . and if the government is going to raise taxes because of that , is there still any justice in this world ? besides , what is wrong with allocating some of the rates collected to the trading fund ? all we have to consider is that we have the right to monitor how the government spends the public funds contributed by taxpayers and whether the money has been properly spent . we have to check whether the government just keeps the huge reserves sitting in the government coffers unused and yet squeezes the people for an extra share of their hard - earned money . in fact , the urban council has a surplus of funds . to a certain extent , it may be necessary to spend money on procuring oil paintings to enhance people 's appreciation of arts . but in the meantime , if the people and the industrial and commercial sector are forced to pay huge amounts they cannot afford , the result may well be the closing down of factories or restaurants , workers losing their jobs or even the inflation being pushed up . when it comes to such a situation , i believe it would not be hard to choose between oil paintings and the rice bowl . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr chan wing - chan : mr president , on 10 january this year , i took the lead in moving a motion in this council on the sewage charges to urge the government to " suspend temporarily the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharges , and to redetermine the charging criteria " . i pointed out that the government 's arbitrary sewage charges had affected the operations of the hotel and catering industries , particularly the catering industry , and resulted in the closing down of restaurants , with more workers losing their jobs . today , on the last day of this legislative session , dr the honourable john tse moves another motion for debate on the sewage charges . this shows that the problem of sewage charges is very complicated . it is a great concern among the people and a highly controversial issue , affecting people 's livelihood directly . in the last motion debate , i pointed out that the government had somehow misled members then in its promotion of the sewage services charging scheme and had this piece of legislation carried by cutting the gordian knot which in turn has led to great controversy afterwards . i am glad that when all members voted unanimously to freeze the government 's proposed increase in the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharges last wednesday , the honourable henry tang from the liberal party pointed out that the government had misled legislative council members in the process of legislation , and today dr john tse from the democratic party has noted the same thing when moving this motion . i dare not claim credit for myself for the success last wednesday in freezing the government 's proposed increase in the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharges . but since i have frequently pointed out in the relevant motion debates in this council and other occasions the impact of the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharges on the catering industry and the general public , i think i have , more or less , helped members reach a consensus . moreover , because of the economic downturn in hong kong and the large number of unemployed workers , such a trend has resulted in the members ' readiness in their support for freezing the increase in the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharge . mr president , the government was too anxious to have the high priority strategic sewage disposal programme completed before 1997 and to balance the revenues and expenditures of the sewage services trading fund that it hastily dished out this defective sewage services charging scheme . it has since been strongly criticized by all circles . earlier on , when the government indicated its plan to redetermine the rates of increase in the sewage charges for the coming years , it caused an uproar of criticisms among the public against the government . the government explained that it had over - estimated the amounts to be paid by the commercial and industrial sector and under - estimated the success rate of appeal cases and thus there was a " discrepancy " of about $100 million short in the government 's revenue . the government was therefore unable to attain the target of receiving $800 million in revenue as expected at the end of 1994 and has to redetermine the rates of increase in the sewage charges . obviously , all the above reasons have resulted from the " miscalculations " by the government in formulating the policy . besides , because of the unfairness in the criteria for and the calculation of the trade effluent surcharges as set initially by the government , some users in the industrial and commercial sector have succeeded in their appeals and had their charges reduced . in fact , the commissioner for administrative complaints noted in a study published in early may this year that the government had made many mistakes in the levy of the trade effluent surcharges . these include the lack of consultation with the restaurant industry which is the most seriously affected and the unfairness in the determination of the charges . from this we can see that in the implementation of this scheme , the government lacked a well - planned budget , nor has it conducted adequate consultation or formulated down a set of fair and reasonable criteria for the charges . therefore , the government is acting irresponsibly in asking the people to bear the consequence of its mistakes . yesterday , the government stated that it would not consider injecting capital into the trading fund . i am very disappointed at the government 's attitude . i want to point out that over the past , the people of hong kong have paid for the operating costs of the sewage services by way of rates , water charges and various taxes . why can the government not appropriate these recurrent expenditures for the trading fund instead of shifting the burden to the people and having them to bear it all by themselves ? basing on the above two reasons , the hong kong federation of trade unions demands that the government bear part of the expenditure by injecting capital into the trading fund every year in order to cover the losses of the trading fund . there is no justification for the government to shirk its original responsibility . in view of that , i would like to make the following suggestions : 1. redetermine the criteria for levying the trade effluent surcharges in order to implement the recommendations in the report of the office of the commissioner for administrative complaints . 2. simplify the appeal procedures to reduce the appeal costs of users in the industrial and commercial sector . 3. the government should inject capital and bear part of the responsibility of sewage disposal . 4. further extend the target period for balancing the revenues and expenditures in order to reduce the future rates of increase in sewage charges . finally , it should be noted that the government has all along overlooked the need to formulate a set of comprehensive measures in the implementation of the sewage disposal programme strategy . mr president , with the gradual completion of sewage disposal projects and the rising operating costs of sewage services , the burden on the people with respect to the sewage charges will be heavier . therefore , the government should really give it a careful review . mr choy kan - pui : mr president , to protect the local environment and ensure good water quality in hong kong is the wish of every hong kong resident . therefore , no one is against the investment in sewage works . but the question is : where does the money come from and from whom this money should be collected ? to efficiently control cost effectiveness and to conform to the " polluter pays " principle , the setting up of the sewage services trading fund is a worthwhile cause to support . because of the low tax policy and the narrow tax base in hong kong , to recover part of or all the cost by way of a trading fund is , after all , a good way to increase our public revenue and it can also be considered an alternative means of widening the tax base . in view of that , i do not think that the government is unjustified in levying the sewage charges after taxing the people or commercial undertakings . furthermore , to operate in the form of a trading fund is a more targeted way of recovering the costs from the users . the " user pays " or " polluter pays " principle is basically acceptable but we cannot divorce ourselves from the real situation and only indulge in empty talks about the principle . when we talk about the " user pays " principle , we cannot ignore who the users are and how they use the facilities in question . take for example the construction of roads . since roads are open to everyone , does it mean that we are to collect a toll from every road user ? by the same token , domestic use of water is essential in everyone 's daily life and normal discharge of sewage is also essential . hence , it is disputable that the sewage charges should be levied on everyone throughout the territory . besides , if the trading fund is to levy the sewage charges according to the quantity of water consumed , then even if it can help to reduce water consumption by the general public , it cannot make people discharge less sewage . thus , the government must conduct an in - depth review immediately on the current way of calculating the sewage charges . as far as the industrial and commercial sector is concerned , sewage charges should be included in their operation costs . therefore , when implementing this principle , it is still necessary for the government to consider the following two issues : (1) is the current trade effluent surcharge reasonable ? from what happened last year , we can see that there are many problems with the present rates of the surcharge , particularly with respect to the catering industry . it is true that taxpayers have no obligation to subsidize the industrial and commercial sector , but at the same time , it is also not fair for some trades in the sector to bear a disproportionate share of the sewage expenditure of the whole community . (2) the impact on our society and the economy as a whole to a certain extent , the government can make use of taxes and public revenue and expenditure to stimulate economic development or prevent an economic downturn . under the present sluggish economy , a sharp increase in the trade effluent surcharge will only add an extra burden on the relevant industries . take the catering industry as an example . this is a labour intensive industry which accommodates large numbers of workers who are not so well - educated or are relatively unskilled . if more and more restaurants close down , it will only aggravate the unemployment problem in hong kong . therefore , in determining the surcharge , the government cannot just rigidly consider having the revenues and expenditures balanced but neglect other social and economic factors . given the above reasons , the hong kong progressive alliance ( hkpa ) has reservations about whether the revenues and expenditures of the sewage services trading fund should be completely balanced . the hkpa holds that part of the revenue of the trading fund should be provided by the government on a yearly basis to subsidize the expenditure on sewage disposal by the general public . in addition , the hkpa has serious doubt about the policy that the investment in the sewage works should be fully recovered within three to five years . the pollution problem does not just come up today . rather , it is an accumulated consequence over a long period and therefore the cost should not be borne solely by the polluters of this generation . our future generations will also benefit from the sewage services scheme upon its completion and hence the cost should not be borne by this generation alone . in light of that , we suggest that the time limit for achieving a balance in the revenues and expenditures of the trading fund should be set at 10 years or over . mr president , i so submit . dr law cheung - kwok : mr president , as a matter of major principle , the hong kong association for democracy and people 's livelihood ( adpl ) agrees that the goal of " polluter pays " should be pursued . however , the public who use water for everyday domestic purposes should not be regarded as polluters . besides , it is very doubtful whether the levying of the sewage charges on the public will effectively reduce the use of domestic water and hence pollution . the adpl thinks that the levying of the sewage charges on the public is , by its very nature , tantamount to the imposition of a poll tax which is an unreasonable charge of regressive nature . therefore , the adpl asks the government to abolish the sewage charges on the ordinary households immediately . the expenditures concerned should be paid out of the general revenue . the adpl agrees that the industrial and the commercial sector should be responsible for the pollution they have caused and they should pay for the costs of building and operating the sewage facilities by the government . however , since the economy is still in the doldrums this year , the operating costs of certain trades and industries such as the catering and dyeing industries have been increasing relatively quickly . besides , it is also not easy to control their business environment . a substantial increase in the sewage charges will make it even more difficult for some trades to continue to operate and so unemployment will become more serious . therefore , the adpl agrees that the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharges should be frozen this year . the adpl demands that the government extend the period of cost recovery for the sewage services trading fund of the drainage services department to 15 or more years and to improve the operating efficiency in order to reduce the rate of increase of the sewage charges . meanwhile , the government should also consider injecting additional funds into the trading fund so as to help pay for the huge expenditure which may be incurred in maintenance and repairs , to cover the nominal interest expenses and to make up for the deficit of the trading fund . at present , the appeal process against the assessment of sewage charges is complicated and costly . even if the appeals lodged by the small and medium-sized businesses are successful , the proprietors may find that their losses outweigh their gains . the adpl thinks that the government should simplify the appeal procedures . more importantly , a more comprehensive and equitable way of calculating the trade effluent surcharges should be formulated so as to get to the root of the problem and reduce the need for appeal . with these remarks , i support dr the honourable john tse 's motion . thank you , mr president . dr anthony cheung : mr president , the government has consistently claimed that the need to increase the sewage charges was based on the " polluter pays " principle and " cost recovery " for the sewage services trading fund . we do not oppose the concept of " cost recovery " in the setting of charges by the government under specific conditions . nor do we oppose the concept of having a " trading fund " . however , the above arguments put forward by the government have obviously equated the three entirely different concepts of " polluter pays " , " cost recovery " and " trading fund " . the specious argument so formed would only reverse the cause and effect , giving rise to public misconceptions regarding the environmental problem . the " polluter pays " principle originated from the environmental protection scheme in germany and subsequently gained the support of the european union . in the 1992 maastricht treaty , the european union urged its member states to adopt this principle for the sake of environmental protection . it was clearly stated in principle 16 of the rio de janeiro declaration , which was endorsed by various countries attending the 1992 united nations earth summit , that the signatories must implement the " polluter pays " principle while at the same time having regard for public interests in a way that would not impede international trade and investment . the " polluter pays " principle literally means that polluters are required to pay for the cost incurred in cleaning up the polluted environment as a result of their acts . the reason is very simple : society needs to deploy resources to deal with the consequences of a damaged environment . the rationale behind this statement is that we should not cause irreparable damage to the environment of future generations just to maintain the present level of affluence and prosperity in society . this view echoes the idea of " sustained development " that environmentalists have always advocated . however , if the meaning behind this message cannot be conveyed to the public through widespread publicity and education , the public may get a wrong impression of the " polluter pays " principle . in the case of sewage disposal , it may be mistaken to mean that the rich who can afford the charges may consume water and discharge waste at will while those who find the charges beyond their means will have to consume less water and reduce the number of visits to the washroom . the charges levied under this principle would thus become a tax to differentiate the social classes . mr president , even though the " polluter pays " principle smacks of the concept of " sustained development " , the government has repeatedly claimed in public that " polluter pays " is equivalent to " cost recovery " . according to the government , the deficit of the sewage services trading fund has necessitated an increase in the sewage charges under the " cost recovery " principle . as a result , the public was given another wrong impression that " polluter pays " was equivalent to " cost recovery " . in view of the exceedingly high charges imposed , they therefore oppose the principle of " polluter pays " . so , is " polluter pays " equivalent to " cost recovery " ? the answer is in the negative . according to the rio de janeiro declaration that i quoted earlier on , public interests should be taken into consideration in the implementation of the " polluter pays " principle . in other words , even from the perspective of international law , the " polluter pays " principle is to be implemented with due consideration given to whether the mode and level of charges imposed under this principle is reasonable to members of the public ; whether the public can afford those charges ; whether the aim of environmental protection can be effectively attained ; and whether the public can be enlightened on the importance of environmental protection through the implementation of the " polluter pays " principle . however , the actual situation is that the rates of increase in the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharge proposed by the government last week far exceeded the inflation rate . after the proposed increase met with strong public opposition and was eventually frozen by this council , the government threatened that the present suppression of the fee increase proposal would only lead to even higher increases in future , putting a heavier burden on members of the public . on the other hand , substantive improvements to sewage disposal can only be made in 1999 upon the completion of phase i of the strategic sewage disposal scheme . the situation we see at present is that the government lacks sincerity in its effort to strike a right balance for the public interest , and members of the public , instead of seeing the rationale behind the concept of " sustained development " , can only see continuous attempts by the government to increase charges in an effort to recover the increasingly high cost . as the principle of " polluter pays " is not equivalent to cost recovery , then is cost recovery equivalent to the " trading fund " concept ? mr president , to begin with , we have to determine what a " trading fund " is all about . as i said in this council two weeks ago when speaking on the resolution about the setting up of a trading fund in the electrical and mechanical services department , in deciding on whether to establish a trading fund in a department , the foremost consideration is whether the operation of the department concerned is of a commercial nature . if it is , then we have to consider whether this department can operate at its own expense on a cost recovery basis . only when the above requirements are met that we should consider transforming the operation of this department into the mode of a trading fund , thereby according greater flexibility for it to deploy its resources so as to enhance its efficiency . in other words , not all government departments can be transformed to operate under a trading fund as it can only apply to services of a commercial nature . otherwise , all services provided by government departments , including the checking of identity cards on streets by the police or the saving of life or property in a disaster by firemen can , theoretically , justify the levying of charges on the service targets or persons affected so as to recover the expenses incurred . besides , not all departments of a commercial nature can manage to operate at their own expense on a cost recovery basis . for those which provide services that can hardly generate profits and stay active in the market , they will not be able to achieve full cost recovery even if the services they provide are of a commercial nature . therefore , trading fund should not be rashly set up in those departments unless the government is prepared to provide a certain amount of subsidy . one of the pre-requisites for the establishment of a trading fund is the capability to recover the cost . nonetheless , in the present case of the sewage services trading fund , the government has misrepresented the " pre-requisite " as the " aim " for the establishment of a trading fund . it claimed that the trading fund was set up for the purpose of cost recovery , while in actual fact a trading fund should be set up because it could recover the cost . this statement of the government has reversed the cause and effect and mixed up different concepts . mr president , when it first proposed the setting up of the sewage services trading fund , the government had made definite promises to secure members ' support . however , as soon as the fund experienced financial problems , failed to keep the cost under control and showed a deficit in its operation , the high - sounding principle of " polluter pays " was used to pressure the public into submission so that an application for a drastic increase in charges could be made to shift the burden to the public . actually , is the government really able to control or reduce the cost through a trading fund ? in the case of an increase in cost , should the government consider disregarding full cost recovery and turn to partial or phased recovery of cost to show consideration for the financial burden of the public ? mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr ip kwok - him : mr president , in a general atmosphere throughout the world of going after environmental protection , the major principle of " polluter pays " has won wide support . in this connection , the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong ( dab ) has been a staunch follower of this principle , and we are in support of the idea that polluters should deal with the pollution they have created . however , we oppose the government 's indiscriminate imposition of the sewage charges on households basing on the " water consumer pays " principle . moreover , we oppose the government 's frantic increase in the sewage charges when the economy is sluggish . last wednesday , through the solidarity of our colleagues , we succeeded in freezing the sewage charges . in the wake of it , the government " threatened " that the freezing of the sewage charges would render the government short of fund for the improvement of sewage facilities , and it would also upset the trading fund 's projection to fully recover the cost within five years ' time . this would eventually cause the trading fund to meet its fate of having to " wind up its business " . the secretary for works in his speech last week accused members of merely prattling about the " polluter pays " principle but being reluctant to take upon themselves the responsibility of any increase in charges as they wanted to freeze the charges . it on the one hand over - estimated the amount of charges business users would be paying while on the other hand under - estimated the number of successful appeal cases . also , it promised that the annual rate of increase would not exceed 10% without having set down any target of balancing the revenues and expenditures . members supported the establishment of the trading fund on the grounds of the aforesaid factors . however , after just one year , the picture is totally different . this is hardly something that members can agree to . mr president , as early as january this year , when the honourable chan wing - chan proposed a motion debate on the sewage charges , the dab already pointed out that in view of the government 's " polluter pays " principle in charging , if the amount of sewage produced by users was on the decrease , the real income derived from the sewage charges as a whole would also decrease , and it would not be possible to recover the cost fully . by then , the government would be bound to continually increase the sewage charges in order to recover the cost . at that time , the dab already warned that if the government did not seriously sort out the problem in financial arrangements and continue to impose sewage charges with recovering the full operating cost as its target , it would only result in creating a big bottomless hole as a burden for the public to bear , and this would render the sufferings of the public beyond redemption . therefore , the dab urges the government to fulfill its promise and review the trading fund . as for the question of finance , the approach the government should consider is an injection of capital into the trading fund in order to balance the revenues and expenditures . the dab opposes the government 's move to recover the full operating cost of the sewage disposal scheme within a short time . we believe that a long - term solution to the problem of deficit in the trading fund is that the government should increase the injection of capital . in respect of this idea , the secretary for works said in the motion debate in january this year that it was against the " polluter pays " principle because this would lead to " the taxpayers subsidizing the polluters " . but the dab thinks that such an argument cannot stand because under the existing sewage charging scheme , over 80% of the households are required to pay the sewage charges . in other words , the taxpayers themselves are also the polluters the secretary for works has referred to . so even if we ask the government to inject capital , the capital will be coming from the taxpayers �0�0 the polluters , so to speak . on the other hand , the dab does not oppose the recovery of cost , but the target period for achieving balance of revenues and expenditures should be extended in order that the annual rate of increase in the sewage charges can be moderated , and the burden on the public can be alleviated . whilst the government has put forth a new proposal that the time period is to be extended from 5 years to 10 years , the proposal is not of much help to alleviate the hardship of the public in respect of the increase , as the lowest increase in the new proposal between the years 1996 and 1999 is still maintained at 15% whilst the peak is as high as 37.7%. therefore , we do not agree to setting the year 2005 as the target . the dab is of the view that the government must be heedful not to set the annual increase of the sewage charges at too high a level whilst it sets the target of balancing the revenues and expenditures , so as not to affect people 's livelihood . mr president , the dab sincerely hopes that the government can take this opportunity that the increase in the sewage charges is frozen to review in detail once again the financial position of the sewage services trading fund and seriously consider whether there are other more effective means , including capital injection and an extension of the time period for balancing the revenue and expenditure , to improve the financial position of the trading fund other than yelling for an increase in charges every year . otherwise , there would be such a day when the trading fund would really " wind up its business " , as the secretary for works has so put it . moreover , judging from the mode of operation of the various trading funds that are now in operation , the dab is afraid that the electronic road pricing scheme , which is based on the " user pays " principle , would also come to a dead end some day as a result of incessant price increases and become a flop . for this reason , the dab hopes that the government will examine closely the mode of operation of its trading funds . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion . the president ' s deputy , mr ronald arculli , took the chair . mr yum sin - ling : mr deputy , the " polluter pays " principle emphasized by the government is basically acceptable , yet the spirit of this principle is fundamentally the same as that of the " user pays " principle . in the current session of this council , the " user pays " principle has aroused controversy on a number of occasions . the government has proposed increases in many of its charges by virtue of this overriding principle . however , when the government formulates its policies , it should not only consider one overriding principle , but also look at a variety of other factors . for instance , the construction cost of the island east corridor was considerable , so does it mean that passing vehicles should be charged ? two weeks ago , the government asked the legislative council panel on planning , lands and works to approve its development plan for tuen mun new town in which a pedestrian footbridge over a road junction would cost $50 million to build . will pedestrians be charged for using the footbridge in the future ? yesterday morning , the government made another request for the panel to approve the funding for dredging the rambler channel to facilitate the passage of deep - draught container vessels so as not to affect the container terminal business . why does the government not adopt the " user pays " principle in these cases ? it is the responsibility of the government to consider all relevant factors instead of rigidly upholding the principle of fairness , just as the government should assist people in need in the community . otherwise , all social welfare programmes can be abolished . therefore , the " polluter pays " principle should not be the sole consideration . it follows that it is worthwhile to conduct a comprehensive review of the sewage services trading fund , which was set up on the basis of this principle . in fact , although the government has often emphasized that the sewage charges comprised only a small percentage in the operation cost of the catering industry or the industrial and commercial sector , yet the percentage is quite high if calculated in terms of net profit . in times of economic recession , the income level of the food and beverage industry would drop and the increase in the sewage charges would further eat into the net profit , dealing a not negligible blow to the industry . there is a chinese saying " to add one catty to a load of one hundred " , which means that if a person finds carrying a load of one hundred catties a hard toil , that would be the limit of his strength , and the addition of even one catty to the load would be the last straw . therefore , a drastic increase in the sewage charges will form a psychological pressure , indirectly resulting in businesses winding up and unemployment . therefore , we strongly oppose a substantial increase in the sewage charges and ask for a review of the criteria for formulating the pollution index . i support this motion which calls for an extension of the time span set for the achievement of a balanced account in the hope of minimizing the annual increase in the sewage charges . should the trading fund experience financial difficulties , one solution is for the government to inject capital into the trading fund , another is to follow the example of the mass transit railway corporation to secure sufficient funds through loans for its continued operation . mr deputy , with these remarks , i support the motion . at this point , dr samuel wong indicated the lack of a quorum . president ' s deputy : can we count the council ? members were then summoned . a quorum was then formed . mr ngai shiu - kit : mr deputy , although the legislative council last wednesday voted against the government 's motion to increase the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharge by 50% this year , the problem has not ended completely . it has been estimated that the sewage services trading fund would incur a huge deficit amounting to several hundred million dollars each year in the next few years . whether the whole sewage disposal programme can continue to operate effectively is still a very difficult problem and will be a big headache . the original aim of setting up the sewage services trading fund was to increase the efficiency of the treatment of sewage by adopting the mode of business operations and this deserved our support . however , the inherent deficiency in the existing trading fund has made it deviate from the original spirit . in the eyes of the public , the government has treated the trading fund as an instrument to seek revenue unfairly . and the government can free itself of the responsibility to treat sewage as soon as the trading fund can assume the sole responsibility for its profits and losses . on the contrary , it has become less important to ensure that the whole sewage disposal programme will operate more effectively . except for the government 's claim that the drainage services department has tried its best to use as little manpower as possible in the treatment of sewage , i cannot see what else the government has done to increase the economic efficiency of the sewage services trading fund . it is the government 's intention to recover the costs of the sewage services trading fund as soon as possible in the next four years and therefore it has to increase the sewage charges substantially each year to achieve an accumulative rate of increase of as high as 168%. the government has turned a deaf ear to the objections raised by the public and a blind eye to the business difficulties of the industrial and commercial sector . it seems that the government has completely treated the sewage services trading fund as a surely profitable business . the public simply do not have the choice that a consumer should have . all they have is the obligation to accept things as they are . since the government has set the sewage charges , the public are compelled to suffer in silence and accept things as they are . for the large number of countries which have levied sewage charges in other parts of the world , while their governments adopt the " polluter pays " principle , they have also paid attention to the ultimate goal of encouraging their people to reduce pollution and improve the environmental conditions . these governments are also not aiming at recovering the full costs in the treatment of sewage . for example in germany , the government only charges around 60% to 70% of the treatment costs . also , it would reduce the sewage charges or even exempt the users from the charges according to the extent of their pollution reduction and the period of cost recovery is as long as 10 years . had the government referred to the valuable experience of these countries before it proceeded with the sewage services charging scheme last year ? mr deputy , some of the existing financial difficulties faced by the sewage services trading fund have been caused by mistakes made by the government . to start with , the drainage services department has seriously over - estimated the number of industrial and commercial organizations which have to pay the sewage charges . then it has neglected the fact that the concentration of sewage has been greatly reduced with the implementation of the water quality control scheme . as a result , the revenue of the trading fund in the first year was $200 million less than the original estimate . this situation has very well indicated that because the government hastily implemented the scheme without careful planning , it has generated cries of discontent all round and has even caused enterprises to close down because they cannot afford to pay the sewage charges . i cannot help asking whether the government 's policy is intended to benefit the people or to harm them and whether the government had considered that such situation would arise when it formulated its policy ? mr deputy , the spirit of the " polluter pays " principle is correct . it is worthwhile to implement the sewage disposal programme in order to improve the water quality of the harbour of hong kong . the task of solving the financial problem of the sewage services trading fund is a hot potato which we are now holding in our hands . in this connection , government officials have , so far , been targeting on the public only . the secretary for works has indicated that the deliberate freezing of the sewage charges by the legislative council would only result in a much higher rate of increase next year , whereas the secretary for the treasury has said that the government has to review whether it should continue to operate the sewage services trading fund . they have completely ignored how the operation of the trading fund can be improved from the perspective of cost effectiveness . mr deputy , i think to really solve the problem arising from the sewage services charging scheme , the review soon to be conducted by the government has to be comprehensive and detailed . the review should cover the original technical details , such as whether the chemical oxygen demand should be taken as the sole criterion for measuring sewage concentration as well as a new assessment of the quantity of sewage discharged by the various trades . more importantly , the government should seriously reconsider the proper aim of the sewage disposal programme and the real purpose of setting up the sewage services trading fund . to get to the root of the problem , i suggest that the government review the rate of return of the sewage services trading fund , to increase the overall efficiency of the trading fund and to conduct a comprehensive study of the facilities , operation and manpower of sewage treatment . meanwhile , the period to achieve a balance in revenue and expenditure should be extended while the aim to fully recover the costs by the year 2000 should be abolished . when the government reviews the rate of increase of sewage charges in the future , it should consider not only the financial position of the trading fund , but also whether such rate is affordable in consideration of the overall economic situation of hong kong . in this way , it will be easier to secure acceptance by the community . i have reservations about this motion which asks the government to inject more capital into the trading fund . the injection of funds by the government may serve to satisfy the urgent need of the trading fund for the moment , but given the circumstances that the expenditure of the trading fund will continue to increase every year without any corresponding rise in revenue , the government 's injection of capital will only be a drop in the ocean . not only would it be unable to " stop the bleeding " , but it may also turn the sewage services trading fund into a " bottomless pond " and a heavy financial burden on the hong kong special administrative region government after 1997 . mr deputy , these are my remarks . miss chan yuen - han : mr deputy , today our discussion is on urging the government to review immediately the sewage charges , and the problems and faultiness of the trading fund , as well as redetermining the rates of increase in the sewage charges . just now my colleague the honourable chan wing - chan has already explained our views and stand , and i shall not repeat them . what i wish to put forth is that the sewage charges levied by the government upon domestic users are based on absolutely unreasonable grounds and criteria of charging , and that they fail to achieve the goals of encouraging people to save water and promoting the public 's awareness of environmental protection . to date , the approach has been reduced to a punitive one which asserts that " members of the public have the obligation to pay " . therefore , since the implementation of the sewage charges , members of the public have presented their views to me and criticized that the sewage charges levied by the government on domestic households are too high . also , their opinion is that the charges are extremely unreasonable . i still remember that in december 1994 , when the government was about to introduce this sewage charging scheme , our colleagues conducted a survey in hong kong island west and interviewed 400 residents in the area . the finding was that more than 70% of the interviewees thought that if they were to pay $130 in water charge a quarter and , on top of that , $40 in sewage charge , the ratio would be too high . at present , for a family of four that consumes 80 units of water a quarter , the water charge is $410 and the sewage charge is $81 based on this method of calculation , making a total of $496 . mr deputy , such a figure is a very heavy burden for people at the grassroots . i believe that people already find it very expensive . therefore , when the government earlier on proposed once again to redetermine the rates of increase in sewage charges , no matter what proposal they would be putting forth and no matter it is in five years or 10 years that balance of revenue and expenditure is to be achieved , i believe the majority of people will not support it , and they will oppose it all the same . now , we are urging the government to review this " defect - ridden " trading fund , and let me ask the government once again to also review what is the meaning of " imposing the sewage charges on domestic users " . as a matter of fact , what do members of the public use water for in their daily lives ? they use it for cooking , for washing their hands and for flushing purposes , and the actual pollution is only very mild , which is even more insignificant in comparison with pollution by the commercial and industrial sector . according to the unaudited figures provided by the drainage services department , in the year 1995-96 , a total of $690 million was collected through the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharges , of which $180 million came entirely from domestic users . this means that the amount from domestic users in the year 1995-96 constituted 26% of the grand total , and it is the government 's intention that about 30% of the charges levied in the future will come from domestic households . i really doubt whether domestic users actually account for 30% of the total pollution . could it be the case that the domestic users are actually subsidizing the business users ? what i know is that the chemical treatment adopted for the entire sewage disposal programme is mainly aimed at treating trade effluent . moreover , the government has never produced any " wear and tear ratio " regarding domestic and other classes of users in relation to the whole sewage disposal system , nor has it presented any justification that domestic users account for 30% of the pollution produced . mr deputy , i wish to ask the government : 1. is the pollution produced by domestic users mild or serious ? 2. would it be necessary to build such a colossal system with its phase i , phase ii and phase iii works if the objective is just for the disposal of domestic sewage ? i hope that when the government reviews the sewage services trading fund ( sstf ) , it will explain with supporting data the different degrees of pollution produced by domestic and business users . otherwise , it will be difficult to convince domestic households why they have to bear the burden of paying such a huge amount of charges . i believe the only explanation is that the charges on domestic households are just ways to raise money from all the people of hong kong under various pretexts to finance the trading fund for the strategic sewage disposal scheme . however , someone may ask how can the trading fund balance its revenue and expenditure if people do not help to raise the money ? mr deputy , i wish to point out that the government is clearly using the trading fund as a shield for this " public service in sewage disposal " in order to shirk certain government responsibilities . we used to pay for the cost of sewage disposal facilities through various taxes . if balance of revenue and expenditure is required for whatever public service the government provides and all costs are to be recovered , i wonder how our tax money has been used ? the government has time and again made excuses to avoid injecting capital into the sstf , and has utterly been unwilling to take upon itself part of the responsibility for these " public services " . i am totally disappointed . finally , mr deputy , i think when the government reviews the sstf , it should reconsider whether or not it is really necessary to include domestic households in the levy of sewage charges . with these remarks , i support the motion . mrs selina chow : mr deputy , this council rejected an application to increase the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharges ( tes ) last week . on that occasion , i had in fact reflected in clear terms the doubts of the relevant businesses on the sewage charges . in fact , the problems of the sewage services trading fund ( sstf ) did not just come up from this discussion on the increase in charges . indeed , soon after the sewage charges were first imposed early last year , many people have already expressed views on the inadequacies of the whole scheme . for this reason , i unreservedly support dr the honourable john tse 's motion . it is my belief that the areas concerning the sstf that need to be reviewed most are the cost - effectiveness of the entire structure , its effectiveness and fairness . at this time when the operation of the trading fund is so confusing and appeals are being lodged one after another , the government should really complete the review as soon as possible and re-adjust the charges to a reasonable level under a proper mechanism and charging system . regarding the existing tes , i would like the government to explain to us two points : first , how did the government arrive at the ratio whereby it was claimed that 80% of the water consumed by a restaurant business will eventually become sewage ? a scientific study conducted in australia has found that only 40% of the water consumed by the restaurant business will become sewage . has the government done any such research ? or was it that the government merely arbitrarily put forth a ratio ? secondly , how did the government determine the respective chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) figures for restaurant sewage in non-water control zones and water control zones ( wczs ) ? the study the government is now quoting for the purpose of determining sewage disposal is a sewage study made at the time when wczs were introduced , and it was made with reference to the non-wczs from tsim sha tsui to kowloon bay . as such , it simply was not made for the purpose of determining the sewage charges . as for the sample tests , the samples were taken from the untreated sewage in grease traps , and there was no reference to the environmental variables under control conditions . thus , the government merely unilaterally " transplanted " a study which is not typical , unscientific and irrelevant , and this is in itself not a proper thing . what is more astonishing is that the figure of cod at 3 600 g per cu m simply cannot be found anywhere in the study . so on what basis is the government relying in arriving at the criteria for charging the tes in non-wczs ? what is even more absurd is that the government made an arbitrary assessment of the cod and set it down at 2 000 g per cu m for restaurants in wczs . it did not even bother to offer a sham , unscientific study . was it because the government realized that the existing legislation has already provided punitive measures against those businesses which produce effluent the cod of which exceeds 2 000 g per cu m in wczs , and therefore it did the " transplant operation " once again and just had it the convenient way by borrowing this figure for the purpose ? the two aforesaid problems are only the most basic ones , as we have a lot more problems to question the government . for example , while it was planned that 30 different trades would share the burden of the tes , why does it turn out that the restaurants alone have to pay a total of $280 million a year , which amounts to 82% of the total tes revenue ? a discerning observer in the trade has reckoned that if we prepare our meal at home , the sewage charge amounts to 1.5 cents , whereas if we dine out , the sewage charge would be 35 cents . that means the sewage charge in question is 23 times more than if we prepare our meal at home . can we say that the cost will not be shifted to the consumers ? can we say that it will not have any impact on people 's livelihood ? another major fallacy is that the whole appeal system is entirely designed to protect the government so that even when the calculations are proved wrong , it can still overcharge and continue to overcharge the tes basing on the erroneous calculations . a living example is that an eatery received its water bill in april last year and lodged an appeal in may . it was not until two months later that the government finally set the time to deal with the case . then after laboratory tests were conducted , it was announced that the appeal was granted at the end of july . however , the government merely calculated the tes for the next 12 months basing on the result of the tests , but made no refund for the money it had overcharged . what makes people feel even more being played around with is that the appeal granted is valid for just one year . after that the government may revert to the original erroneous presumption to calculate the tes , and then the eatery in question will have to appeal once again ! in view of the fact that the appeal process is lengthy and the system is costing people money every year , while the appellants cannot claim back the money overcharged , as long as the government does not rectify it , the entire appeal mechanism will only be reduced to a government measure to exploit and oppress people . we must bear in mind that for each of the appeals we are talking about , it is not a question of just a few thousand dollars . rather , it costs over $30,000 for the laboratory tests and , even if an appeal is granted , the government will not compensate the proprietor for the expenses paid in proving that the government has erred . what kind of justice is this ? could it be that the government wants to punish those proprietors who are unconvinced ? figures show that 90% of the catering businesses pay less than $30,000 in the tes a year . so , the appeal system designed by the government will no doubt discourage these small businesses from lodging an appeal . i wonder whether it is the government 's deliberate intention to set up obstacles to deter them from lodging appeals ? examples that raise doubts among us that the government 's real aim is to make money are not yet exhausted . it is surprising that under the ordinance on water quality control zones , the environmental protection department ( epd ) has actually refused to provide eateries that come to seek assistance with any means to minimize the grease component in sewage . it merely says that there should be ways to achieve that . however , the epd has actually refused to provide any information as to where such advice may be sought ! the government cannot blame us for criticizing it . as a matter of fact , the government has aimed to achieve the object of money - grabbing using environmental protection as a pretext . it surprises us that there are members in this council who blindly support this harsh policy , and who even accuse us of being hypocritical . this goes completely against the rightful responsibility of this council to ensure that the government implements policies reasonably . the government aims to impose fines and make money , and it simply does not proceed from the good intention of minimizing pollution to the environment . no wonder people in the catering industry have grumbled , " how can we have so much money for it to suck at ! " i thought about setting up an ad hoc committee in this legislative session to take follow - up actions specifically regarding the review on the sstf . however , in view of the fact that the term of the ad hoc committee in question will have to end by the close of this legislative council session , and since the government has indicated that a consultant will be commissioned to review the issue , i hope that i can put forth the proposal in the coming session . mr deputy , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr leung yiu - chung : mr deputy , i would like to voice some of my opinions regarding the sewage charges , the sewage services trading fund and the recent performance of the drainage services department ( dsd ) . first of all , it is the question about the domestic households as polluters . the definition of polluters , according to the government , covers both domestic and business users . i am fully in support of the analysis just made by dr the honourable law cheung - kwok on polluters , especially in regard to domestic households . as a matter of fact , we all understand that it is a basic need for domestic households to discharge sewage , the nature of which is totally different from that of businesses which earn revenue and profits . however , it is very unfortunate that the government has not considered the question from this angle and has instead used this general term " polluters " to refer to domestic households and then levied the charges on them . this kind of charges has actually become a disguised form of tax , which is in essence a poll tax . however , if it is really considered a form of tax , then i do not see any reason why the government should impose such a poll tax by another name , as the government at the present moment is in fact enjoying a surplus . why does it have to specifically create another form of tax ? it is hence unreasonable . if the government continues to use this " polluter pays " argument to levy the sewage charges on domestic households , it should be deemed an unreasonable move and i am definitely against it . secondly , it is about the levying of the sewage charges on the commercial and industrial sector . as a matter of fact , if we look closely at this move , we surely hope that business operators will discharge less waste water . however , the present approach of the government does not have any motivating effect at all , and it is only meant to generate some punitive effects . other countries have understood the levy of sewage charges differently . for instance , a recent work report published by the world bank indicates , according to the experience of california in the united states , that two thirds of the pollutants found in the rivers have not come from industrial zones where the sources of discharge can be found . although the waste discharge of business enterprises can be controlled by " sewage charges " , they cannot be a permanent solution to the overall pollution problem . besides , the levy of the trade effluent surcharge on business enterprises is more of an ex post facto compensation . it basically cannot prevent pollution and its effect is really limited . many businesses will usually incorporate the sewage charges into their costs and , in the end , the charges will be shifted to the consumers . whether we look at it from the angle of environmental protection or from the angle of consumption spending of the public , this policy of levying the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharge is a total failure . thirdly , the dsd intends to greatly increase the sewage charges by 168% within the next four years in order that the sewage services trading fund can recover its operating costs . i reckon that the sewage discharge project , which involves a huge amount of investment , is a kind of large - scale infrastructure that should be constructed by the government . the cost of construction should not be borne by the domestic or business users . thus the present case is even more ridiculous as the government seeks to greatly increase the charges simply because it has made a wrong calculation . fourthly , this council vetoed the proposal to increase the sewage charges last week . a few days ago , the government hinted that it would extend the target period of cost recovery from five years to 10 years . i think this proposal will not be of much help to the whole sewage scheme . as a matter of fact , the most essential thing is that the government can greatly increase its capital injection to solve the problem . that will be a proper approach if the government can consider the issue from this angle . fifthly , the government has time and again emphasized that the legislative council members of the last session endorsed the sewage charges and complained that the policy should be changed so abruptly . however , the government has not contemplated that many of the legislative council members here are not members of the last session . i hope that the government can respect the wishes of the legislative council members of the current session . besides , things will generally change , especially after going through the test of time . i hope the government will realize that we cannot always stick to past conventions . we have to see this society progressing . we have to derive some insights from experience . every year , there are some amendment bills enacted by the legislative council . what is the actual reason ? the reason is that some outdated or improper pieces of legislation have to be amended . therefore , i hope the government will not increase the sewage charges often on the excuse that this motion was carried by the legislative council in the last session . as a matter of fact , the government has already set up an inter - departmental working group in january this year to review the trade effluent surcharge . but it is not until august that a consultant will be commissioned to study that project . and it is estimated that the study will not be complete until january next year . i am rather puzzled as the government indicated in january that an inter - departmental working group would be set up to study the issue , why is it necessary to have a consultant to further study this project ? is it not a waste of public funds ? in fact , i hope the government can understand that in order to implement environmental protection , it should put more emphasis on prevention instead of making blackmails afterwards in the name of environmental protection . therefore , i hope that the government 's study can attach greater importance to how to prevent pollution instead of how to increase the levy on us . mr deputy , i so submit . mr chan kam - lam : mr deputy , i believe the speech that i am going to give in the small hours this morning must be the shortest one that i have ever given since i was elected a legislative council member . the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong ( dab ) 's stance on the sewage charges and the sewage treatment system is very clear . the dab supports the " polluter pays " principle . however , we think that in defining who are the polluters , the general public should not be treated as the main group of users of sewage treatment because domestic sewage results from people 's normal daily lives . therefore , the government should not impose any domestic sewage charges on the general public . as my colleague , the honourable miss chan yuen - han , has asked , is it really necessary to use a sewage treatment system which costs $20 billion to treat the everyday domestic sewage of the public ? after the legislative council decided to have the sewage charges frozen last wednesday , senior government officials have repeatedly said that taxes would have to be increased to make up for the expenditure and to recover the costs . mr deputy , it is very obvious where the problem lies . when the government was asking for the building of a sewage treatment system , it made great efforts in explaining the rationale of environmental protection and pledged in all sincerity to members that such a system would only cost the public very little in the future . however , the government seldom talks about environmental protection today and it has even threatened the public with its theory that if the sewage charges are not increased , a small number of polluters will have to subsidize a large number of other polluters . in our debate today , we can understand that members have gradually realized that they were actually deceived by the government . undoubtedly , the public have to shoulder a very heavy burden of paying the sewage charges in the future . however , the government should review the trading fund again and consider how it should be operated in the future . thank you , mr deputy . the president resumed the chair . mr chim pui - chung : mr president , my fellow townsman , the honourable chan kam - lam , has expressed the views i wish to express , and these are the views of the general public . the clerk of the legislative council passed me a note , asking whether or not i would like to speak . the principle i want to discuss is that in future the hong kong government will not demand anything from us . the principle is that we have to abide by the law of hong kong , and that the whole future is in our hands . now that we are here watching the sky , and the sky and the earth represent what hong kong people want from us , and that we are to express our views justly . perhaps in the next three minutes the honourable ronald arculli will leave his seat , so , i ask him to drink " the wine of god " which he wishes to drink within five minutes , and that will be the moment of one 's true feelings . ( laughter ) president : mr chim pui - chung , please speak to the question . you are not suggesting that mr ronald arculli drinks the sewage , are you ? mr chim pui - chung : the honourable tsang kin - shing will soon be coming to protest against you for the oppression you have on him . this does not mean anything . it is merely fun for everybody . the british government 's representative chris patten is now in his sleep , so why should we be so serious , right ? everything that is forthcoming represents what the future hong kong special administrative region government expects of the hong kong people , and that is the real future we have to face . and the real future represents everything that is true , and everything that is true means that there is no lying . it represents everything of the people in future , and it means that we are always under the leadership of the political system . it means that we are very happy under the leadership of the president , making further efforts to strive for what we want to do . now , mr arculli , you have something to say . please stand up and speak for me . what do you want to say ? president : may i remind members to speak to the question ? secretary for works : mr president , at the sitting last week , this council debated our proposal to increase the sewage charges and trade effluent surcharge . the government has quite a number of grounds , for example , the impact on the cost the food business and households in general have to bear . i do not intend to repeat them . some members are of the view that the general public should not be required to pay sewage charges , but let us not forget the fact that there are 6 million people producing sewage everyday . i think the government 's proposal to increase charges has already taken into consideration the economic burden on the society . regrettably , this council decided to freeze both charges at their existing levels . it would send a wrong message to the public that polluters need not be responsible for the problems they cause to the environment . today , dr honourable john tse 's motion on a review of the sewage services trading fund has given me a very good opportunity to explain the way forward for the sewage services trading fund once again . the sewage services trading fund was set up in march 1994 by a legislative council resolution . in passing the resolution , this council had agreed to our proposal of recovering all operating cost of sewage treatment from polluters in the form of sewage charges and trade effluent surcharge in accordance with the " polluter pays " principle . under the relevant legislation , trading fund accounts are subject to the scrutiny of this council and the public . they are also subject to independent audit by the audit department . on 18 october 1995 , i already tabled the sewage services trading fund annual report and accounts for the year 1994-95 at this council . moreover , dr john tse demands the injection into the trading fund the construction cost of the sewage treatment facilities as it has been . as a matter of fact , the construction cost of the sewage treatment facilities was provided by government in the form of capital injection , and polluters are only paying for the operation and maintenance of sewage treatment facilities . both dr john tse in moving his motion and the honourable henry tang , who spoke last week have mentioned about extending of the breakeven period for the sewage services trading fund . in response to such requests , the government proposed at the subcommittee meeting held on 19 june to extend the period to achieve full recovery of operating cost after depreciation from 1999-2000 to 2004-05 . dr tse has also mentioned the average annual increase of 20%. this is in fact only one of our methods of calculation . however , members of the subcommittee did not discuss and analyse our proposal . i sincerely hope that honourable members will work with the government to come up with a solution acceptable to all so that the sewage services trading fund can achieve a balanced budget . injection of fresh additional funds into the trading fund to meet the operating expenses would go against the trading funds ordinance , which requires a trading fund to be managed in such a way that expenses are met out of its income . it would also go against the " polluter pays " principle . the implication of such a move is that taxpayers would directly subsidize polluters . it is difficult to justify why taxpayers rather than polluters themselves should meet the costs of treating the sewage . the 1995-96 deficit of the sewage services trading fund is estimated to be about $66 million . freezing of the sewage charges and the trade effluent surcharge at their existing levels will result in the exhaustion of all trading fund working capital around the end of this year or the beginning of next year . without an increase in charges , as dr tse has said , the only way in which the deficit could be met would be by cutting back our preventive maintenance programme or delaying the commissioning of newly completed facilities . these measures are of course extremely undesirable and would mean serious setbacks in our effort to improve the water quality in our harbour . as for the simplification of procedures for appeals against the trade effluent surcharge , as i have said in our debate last week the government will appoint a consultant to review the trade effluent surcharge scheme , including the appeal procedures under it . the review will be completed early next year . findings will be reported to the relevant panel of this council . mr president , pollution in our harbour has already reached a critical state . if the sewage services trading fund cannot be allowed to operate properly , the problem will only deteriorate further . to this end , i appeal to honourable members to continue their support of the " polluter pays " principle and work with the government for a feasible solution to enable the sewage services trading fund to operate as a viable proposition . thank you , mr president . president : dr john tse , you are now entitled to reply and you have four minutes 10 seconds out of you original 15 minutes . dr john tse : mr president , first of all i would like to respond to the secretary for works in regard to the question of solving the pollution problem by increasing charges . a member of the public has once said to me that it is very easy to be a senior government official , as all you have to know is to increase the charges in order to solve a problem . and a senior government official has also said to me that it is very easy to be a legislative council member , as all you have to know is to oppose any increase in charges and then the problem can be solved . i am very happy tonight ( i should say that i am very happy this morning ! ) that there are so many members supporting my stance . and i have very seldom seen that the legislative council is so unanimously in support of a motion . as a matter of fact , in the speeches of 14 honourable members , aside from the honourable chim pui - chung , who expressed that he was very happy , and also except for the four members who said that the government should not levy the sewage charges , we have a consensus in general , that is , most of the members want a capital injection from the government . therefore , i feel rather disappointed in respect of the persistent stance of the secretary of works in not preparing to inject any capital . apart from the honourable ngai shiu - kit , almost all the members have asked for a capital injection . the second common stance that i have observed is that quite a number of members have reckoned that the speed of cost recovery is too fast and that they hope that the period for cost recovery can be extended . many members have queried the cost - effectiveness concerned . i think that this point can be discussed later on together with the fourth point and which is , a lot of members are in support of reviewing the operation of the trading fund as soon as possible . we generally agree that the existing operation of the fund has a very low transparency . even the legislative council finds it difficult to monitor its operation . individual members have put forward some rather good views . the honourable henry tang has suggested that the government should tap other sources of revenue and approach the urban council . he has also made a comparison and asked whether the government would prefer oil paintings to people 's livelihood . i think that this is worth studying by the government . the honourable chan wing - chan , on behalf of the restaurant and catering industry , has raised some questions in that respect and queried the insufficient consultation . dr the honourable law cheung - kwok has remarked that the sewage charges are tantamount to a poll tax . this idea is echoed by not a few members . however , although many members have pressed for a capital injection , the secretary for works so far has given us no explanation why the government is not willing to inject capital . if there is no capital injection , we all know that the consequences could be very serious . if the fund is going to take out loans in case there is a deficit , " interest " will be incurred . i do not agree that the fund should shoulder any interest . i hope that the government can consider my motion . as a matter of fact , my motion is a rather mild one . if such a motion is moved by the other members , they may even ask for no levying of sewage charges . it would be even worse then ! generally speaking , the ultimate aim of levying sewage charges is to improve the environment , improve the water quality of hong kong , protect marine life , wild animals and human beings , and even to provide more recreational areas . at present , a lot of beaches in hong kong are no longer suitable for swimming . i hope that the government can make more positive improvement in sewage discharge and bring about a cleaner environment . thank you , mr president . question on the motion put and agreed to . stationing of chinese armed forces in hong kong after 1997 dr anthony cheung to move the following motion : " that this council urges that the chinese government , in formulating the laws governing the armed forces to be stationed in the future hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) , should : ( a ) conduct open consultation with the people of hong kong on the relevant draft bills and trully listen to the views of all sectors ; ( b ) make provisions in the legislation to ensure that the armed forces will not interfere in the internal affairs of the sar , and will be deployed to assist in the maintenance of public order and rescue operations only upon formal requests made by the chief executive of the sar in accordance with law ; and ( c ) make provisions in the legislation to ensure that members of the armed forces involved in civil cases and criminal offences are subject to the jurisdiction of the hong kong courts , so as to give full effect to the spirit of " one country , two systems " and " hong kong people ruling hong kong with a high degree of autonomy " in the joint declaration . " dr anthony cheung : mr president , i move the motion standing in my name on the order paper . the motion we are debating today is the " stationing of chinese armed forces in hong kong after 1997 " . it is moved because china is now drafting the law that governs the activities and conduct of the chinese armed forces to be stationed here in the future hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) . it has been reported that the drafting of this garrison law would be completed by the end of the year . it would be given to the preparatory committee for discussion early next year and then tabled at the national people 's congress for approval and promulgation . the democratic party believes that it is timely and necessary to bring the subject to this council for debate when the drafting of such law is still underway . it is our hope that different parties would voice their opinions in this debate , thereby stimulating the general public to discuss the issue . we opine that the chinese government should , once the first draft of the law is completed , publish the draft bill and conduct an open consultation with the people of hong kong to truly listen to the views of all sectors . issues such as how to regulate specifically the role and conduct of the armed forces to be stationed in hong kong through the garrison law and how to clarifying the jurisdiction concerning the garrison forces are closely related to the well being of the people of hong kong . during the drafting stage and before its promulgation , the draft of the garrison law should not be given to the preparatory committee for internal consultation only . rather , an open and extensive consultation concerning the contents of the garrison law should be conducted with the people of hong kong and the views of all sectors should also be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the garrison law , when promulgated , will be widely accepted by the people of hong kong . mr president , the stationing of armed forces to manifest china 's sovereignty over hong kong is something we will not question . article 14 of the basic law stipulates three important principles concerning the chinese armed forces to be stationed in hong kong : that they are stationed in the sar for defence ; that they shall not interfere in the local affairs of the sar ; and that they shall , only upon request from the sar government , assist in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief . in order to confirm the future roles of the chinese armed forces in hong kong , it is necessary to reiterate these three major principles in the garrison law and to provide further elaboration and control . in this regard , the people of hong kong are especially concerned about the situation under which the armed forces would be deployed to take action . article 14 of the basic law has only laid down the basic principle : " that the government of the sar may , when necessary , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief . " under this principle , two levels of power are involved , namely the power to make a request and the power to deploy the armed forces . as for the latter , it stipulates who should have the power to actually deploy the armed forces and what procedures and arrangements should be followed when making any deployment . it is a common practice in many countries that the power to make a request to deploy the armed forces rests with the top government leader concerned . in view of this , we suggest that such power should rest specifically with the chief executive of the sar . as for the power to deploy the garrison , we respect the existing arrangement that such power is vested in the central government . we therefore suggest that upon receipt of the sar chief executive 's formal and lawful request , the central government could , after examining the request according to law , give its consent and order the deployment of the armed forces stationing in hong kong . the democratic party opines that it is not appropriate for the sar chief executive to make a direct request to the garrison forces in hong kong , because the power of deployment should belong to the central government and its military deployment mechanism . the purposes of making the deployment should be restricted to the maintenance of public order and disaster relief only , with the exception of wartime defence . yet the procedures concerning wartime defence should also be provided for in the garrison law . when drafting the garrison law , the chinese government should stipulate , from the point of view of the central government , the two powers concerned clearly . on the other hand , supervision over the power to make a request is also an important issue . the definitions of " when necessary " , " public order " , as well as " disaster relief " are issues that the chief executive of the sar has to handle . in view of such , we suggest that the future sar should also consider drafting local laws in this respect . in order to prevent " the power to request for assistance from the garrison " from being abused , it is necessary for the future sar to enact legislation concerning the exercise of this power and set up relevant mechanism , so that the chief executive of the future sar could exercise this power in accordance with the law . specifically , the chief executive should make the best effort to ensure that while making a request to the central government for deployment of the garrison , the legislature would be informed of such a request . he should state the reasons behind and should also be prepared to receive and answer questions that will be put to him . in case of an emergency , the chief executive should also explain to the general public and submit a report to the legislature as soon as possible . mr president , another important question concerning the armed forces to be stationed in hong kong is the jurisdiction concerning the people 's liberation army ( pla ) . at the moment , article 14 of the basic law only stipulates that in addition to abiding by national laws , members of the garrison shall abide by the laws of the sar . however , it does not have any clear provision concerning the specific jurisdiction of the garrison . the question here is when members of the garrison are involved in civil and / or criminal cases , how such cases should be handled . should the cases be tried in the pla 's military courts or should they be tried in the civil courts of the sar ? there has been an opinion that the principle of " the military court takes precedence " should be adopted . in other words , when members of the garrison are involved in civil and / or criminal proceedings , china 's practice in this respect should be followed and the cases would be tried in the military courts first . it is only when the military courts decide not to conduct the trial that such cases should be tried in the civil courts . it has been pointed out that as the pla has all along been governed by the laws in china , members of the garrison would naturally be more familiar with the legal system in china and less familiar with hong kong 's common law system . as such , to subject them to hong kong laws would pose certain difficulties . besides , as the status of the pla is rather special , to govern them with the legal system which they are more familiar with should minimize any possible conflict that might arise from the legal systems . as a matter of fact , the principle of " the military court takes precedence " has long been adopted in china . the 1951 " reply from the supreme people 's court in relation to the jurisdiction of cases of disputes between serving members of the armed forces and the masses " spells out clearly that if the defendant is a soldier , the case should be tried in the military court ; but if the defendant is an ordinary citizen , the case should be tried in the relevant civil court of the locality concerned . the 1982 " stipulations concerning court cases involving the armed forces and the local authorities " reiterates this principle of " the military court takes precedence " . however , if this principle were to be followed after 1997 under the garrison law , then the special status of the " hong kong system " under " one country , two systems " would be overlooked . the democratic party believes that the future garrison law of the sar should be able to attain the " three compliances " : compliance with the spirit of " one country , two systems " , compliance with the basic law , as well as compliance with the regulatory and legal principles that the hong kong people are familiar with . article 14 of the basic law has stipulated clearly that members of the garrison shall abide by the laws of the sar ; and the laws of the sar should include both the common law and the statute law . article 19 of the basic law has stipulated that the courts of the sar shall have full jurisdiction over all cases in the sar ( with the exception of acts of state ) . rigid and indiscriminate application of the principle of " the military court takes precedence " would make it impossible for the courts of the sar to exercise in full the jurisdiction that has been vested in them . it would also be impossible for the " hong kong system " under " one country , two systems " to continue the special spirit of the common law . the democratic party believes that only by adopting the principle of " the civil court takes precedence " could the spirit of the common law be maintained . for this purpose , we suggest the following specific methods : (1) all civil and criminal cases between off - duty members of the garrison and the ordinary people or those between members of the garrison , so long as they have happened outside the barracks , should be handled in accordance with the principle of " the civil court takes precedence " and be tried in the civil courts . it is only when the civil courts find it inappropriate for them to conduct the trial that the cases should be tried in the military courts . (2) for cases between members of the garrison , only those which took place within the barracks should be handled according to the principle of " the military court takes precedence " . if the armed forces notify the chief executive of the sar that they do not wish to try the cases concerned in the military courts , then the chief executive would issue the required documents and the cases should be tried in the courts of the sar . some people have argued that as the jurisdiction of the british garrison in hong kong has an inclination towards " the military court takes precedence " , why can the sar not just follow this principle ? currently , the british garrison is stationed in hong kong in the manner that hong kong is a british colony . this is very much different from the way the pla garrison is to be stationed in the sar under the " one country " aspect . as such , the principle of " the military court takes precedence " adopted by the british garrison in hong kong , which differs from the principle of " the civil court takes precedence " under the english common law system , is itself a colonial system and ought to be abolished . in addition , a lot of the privileges and exemptions enjoyed by the british garrison in hong kong are derived from this colonial garrison law . it is questionable whether such privileges and exemptions should be maintained after 1997 . some people think that in order to avoid trouble , all those privileges and exemptions enjoyed by the british garrison as stipulated under the some 100 ordinances in hong kong could simply be " adapted " and passed on to the pla . this would mean that the privileges currently enjoyed by the british forces as a colonial garrison would be continued . this is certainly not in line with the status of the garrison to be stationed in hong kong under the " one country " aspect . the democratic party is of the opinion that the privileges and exemptions to be enjoyed by the chinese garrison should be arranged in accordance with the actual needs derived from their duties . it is because some of the existing arrangements have originated from the unequal political relations between britain and her colonies , and some have also become obsolete with the passage of time . as such , it is necessary to study one by one the privileges and exemptions currently enjoyed by the british garrison in hong kong to determine what should be retained and what should be abolished . mr president , that many hong kong people have all sorts of worries concerning the pla to be stationed here is an objective fact . rather , they are worried whether the pla could be a law - abiding force , not seeking special privileges and not interfering in the internal affairs of the sar . if the garrison law can focus on the roles , duties , deployment as well as jurisdiction of the armed forces to be stationed in hong kong and , after an extensive consultation with the people of hong kong , provide specific stipulations that are in line with the principle of " one country , two systems " and the spirit of the basic law , that should greatly help the garrison to establish a good and dignified image among the people of hong kong . mr president , with these remarks , i move the motion . question on the motion proposed . president : mr ip kwok - him has given notice to move an amendment to this motion . his amendment has been printed on the order paper and circularized to members . i propose that the motion and the amendment be debated together in a joint debate . council shall debate the motion and the amendment together in a joint debate . i now call on mr ip kwok - him to speak and to move his amendment . after i have proposed the question on the amendment , members may express their views on the motion and the amendment . mr ip kwok - him 's amendment to dr anthony cheung 's motion : " to delete everything after the words " that this council " and substitute with the following : " supports that the chinese government formulate the military law for the future hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) in order to implement the provisions in article 14 of chapter ii of the basic law , which stipulate that armed forces stationed by the central people 's government in the sar for defence shall not interfere in the local affairs of the region , that the government of the sar may , when necessary , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief and that , in addition to abiding by national laws , members of the garrison shall abide by the laws of the sar . " mr ip kwok - him : mr president , i move that dr the honourable anthony cheung 's motion be amended as set out under my name on the order paper . mr president , the stationing of chinese armed forces in hong kong after 1997 is a major manifestation of the return of sovereignty to china . the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong ( dab ) agrees that the people of hong kong should actively put forward their ideas about the future garrison law . in the past three years , the dab has discussed with mr qian qichen , vice premier of the state council ; mr lu ping , director of the hong kong and macau affairs office of the state council ; and mr xu huizi , deputy chief of the general staff of the people 's liberation army ( pla ) , issues concerning the garrison law and the jurisdiction of the courts of the hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) , the co-ordination between the garrison and various sar government departments , as well as the image of the pla , which is the biggest concern of the people of hong kong . from them , the dab has got a clear message that other than providing clearly the basic principles and policies under which the central government is to govern the defence and garrison of hong kong , the garrison law will also set out the duties and powers as well as the discipline and obligations of the garrison forces to be stationed here . mr president , the original motion demands that the chinese government openly consult the people of hong kong when formulating the garrison law . i wonder if dr cheung has , when putting forward this demand , considered the present realistic situation of hong kong because it is simply impossible for the chinese government to " openly consult " the people of hong kong when drafting the garrison law of the sar . the garrison law is part of chinese laws . the sar is only entitled to demand that the pla should also abide by the sar laws besides abiding by the chinese laws , but it has no right to demand that china follow its idea on how the garrison law is to be formulated . mr president , if such a demand from dr cheung is adopted , the dab is worried that there will be a false impression that the chinese government does not even consult the public and that the chinese government refuses to listen to the views of hong kong people and has no regard for the people 's wishes . that is what the dab and we , the people of hong kong , do not wish to see . the dab thinks that the people of hong kong should make full use of all the channels available in hong kong , such as via the preparatory committee of the sar , to actively make known their points for reference by the departments in china responsible for drafting the garrison law . an open consultation , i am afraid , only sounds good to the ears but is nonetheless impractical . earlier , dr cheung has announced his proposal on how the jurisdictions of the sar courts and the military court of the garrison are to be divided in order to put in place his so - called " principle that the civil court takes precedence " . according to dr cheung , if a chinese soldier violates the local law and civilians are involved , the case should be tried by a court of the sar . however , take the present hong kong as an example , although the law provides that the british forces stationed here have to obey the law of hong kong and the courts in hong kong have jurisdiction over any violations , if the british soldiers commit an offence during their operations and such acts are related to their duties , then the case will be turned over to the british military court . mr president , the judiciary of a country does not normally hear any case involving the operations of the military . this is not something unique to a colony . rather , it is a common practice in many countries . whereas some may worry that the future garrison law of china will weaken the jurisdiction of the sar over the garrison forces stationed here , such understanding , or misunderstanding , is in fact wrong . the jurisdiction over the garrison in the sar has in fact been laid down in principle in the joint declaration and the basic law . article 14 of the basic law stipulates that the garrison forces stationed here shall not interfere in the local affairs of the sar . other than abiding by chinese national laws , the military forces also have to abide by the laws of the sar . moreover , article 19 of the basic law stipulates that the sar shall be vested with independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication . except for matters specified in subsections 2 and 3 , that is , cases relating to defence and foreign affairs , the courts of the sar have adjudication over all cases . from this we can see that the jurisdiction over the garrison in the future sar has already been clearly set down . therefore , we suggest dr cheung take some time to study carefully the sections in the basic law in this respect . mr president , for three consecutive weeks , this council has been discussing issues on " the confidence crisis over the implementation of the basic law " and today 's motion debate is yet another one . the subjects of these debates somehow give people a feeling that some members are trying to take others ' jobs into their own hands and they have constantly urged the chinese government to do this and that . the dab thinks that we have to be perfectly justified when dealing with everything and this is even more important for a legislature . as part of the constitutional framework of the colony , the present legislative council should only put forward motions that are within the administration of the hong kong government . regrettably , colleagues from the democratic party have time and again moved motions that go beyond the functions and authority of the legislative council . i must emphasize again that the dab is not against the people of hong kong expressing their views to the chinese government . but in the legislative council , we should do things that are appropriate in our capacity as members of this council and we should express our views in this respect to the chinese government through the right channel , that is , via the hong kong government . mr president , my colleagues from the dab and i are of the opinion that since it has been provided clearly in the joint declaration and the basic law already , while the chinese leadership has repeatedly assured the people of hong kong and the sino - british joint liaison group has formed an unofficial specialist team to study the issue , we have reasons to believe that the garrison law to be enacted will have strict control over the activities of the pla soldiers to be stationed here and it will also provide full protection for the sar jurisdiction . with these remarks , i move the amendment . president : may i enquire , mr ip , whether you were raising a point of order in your speech or were you making a political point when you said that some motions had exceeded the scope of the power of this council ? question on the amendment proposed . mr david chu : mr president , before pressing on , let me say my amendment has been fused with that by the honourable ip kwok - him . our joint effort is intended to illustrate in the clearest terms two opposite approaches towards the future garrison . one approach is fear mongering and another is calm thinking . over these three weeks , we have indeed been treated to consecutive motions which have one aim : to fan anxiety about our future with fewer than 365 days to go before china regains sovereignty of hong kong . i find both the content and the timing of these motions deplorable . as chosen leaders of our community , we should be easing rather than stirring up public fears . the people 's liberation army ( pla ) is not a force of foreign occupation . the pla soldiers are not our enemies . they are the young sons and daughters of people who are like us , people with feelings . they will miss their parents and friends . we should welcome them just as we have long done the same for the british troops . we must not alienate or ostracize them to score political points . the responsibilities of the pla garrison are listed clearly in basic law article 14 which states : " military forces stationed by the central people 's government in the hong kong special administrative region for defence shall not interfere in local affairs of the region . the government of the hong kong special administrative region may , when necessary , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief . " the future role of the pla is virtually identical to that of the british garrison since 1841 . those of us who have observed the pla 's drills and its high discipline have no doubt that the soldiers posted here will serve with honour and distinction . let us debunk a few myths about the pla as a government within a government . the vice-chairman of the chinese central military commission , general liu huaqing , has outlined five broad principles governing the pla garrison . these principles concern : duties and limits of the power of the garrison ; management of that garrison ; relations and communication between the garrison and the sar ; relations between the troops ' affiliation and leadership command ; and the central government 's management of the garrison for defence purposes . none of these principles threatens the autonomy of the sar and the liberty of the people of the sar . they are all derived from basic law article 14 . the future hong kong pla commander major general liu zhenwu has suggested to the british counterpart that the chinese garrison here may number around 9 000 troops . such a garrison strength is significantly lower than the 25 000 british troops stationed here at the time the joint declaration was signed . we can be sure that our police can deal with public order and also work with the garrison . the pla will provide maritime patrol and external security just as the british forces have done for decades . the motion today also calls for the pla to be subject to sar laws . of course , soldiers outside the barracks are subject to sar laws just like everyone else . the chances for them breaking the law are , however , slim since they are to have their rest and recuperation not in tsim sha tsui but in shenzhen . the pla will not be a burden on the sar . the chinese central government shall pay for its full deployment unlike today in which we must continue to pay part of the british garrison 's costs . the pla will cause us no harm , but do us plenty of good . for this , those behind the motion today have not shown enough gratitude . the chinese military has voluntarily ceded to hong kong between $65 billion and $100 billion worth of defence land for our commercial and residential development . nobody recalls such generosity from the british forces . yes , i ask legislators to support the amendment so as to send the correct message to china and to its pla . i want hong kong groups , particularly the youths , to organize regular social events that involve the pla . by getting together , the soldiers and the civilians would come to know each other better and overcome any future misunderstanding . i have children of roughly the same age as some of the pla soldiers . while my children are abroad , i want them to be treated well by their hosts . my home and my heart are always open to young people , whether or not they are in uniform . i know you share this sentiment . thank you , mr president . mr bruce liu : mr president , the chinese government will station its people 's liberation army ( pla ) in hong kong for defence purpose in accordance with article 14 of the basic law upon its resumption of sovereignty over hong kong in 1997 . however , the basic law contains no explicit stipulations on the jurisdiction of the courts of the special administrative region ( sar ) in relation to the garrison , the mechanism for communication and co-ordination between the garrison and the sar government and the specific criteria relating to requests by the sar government for assistance from the garrison when necessary , thus leaving behind some grey areas . in the formulation of the garrison law , the chinese government should clarify the foregoing ambiguities in the basic law while taking into account the unique circumstances of the hong kong sar under the principle of " one country , two systems " . prior to the official endorsement of the garrison law by the national people 's congress , the chinese government should , in the first place , widely consult the people of hong kong on the draft law so that the end product will be compatible with the unique social circumstances of the hong kong sar and be acceptable to the people of hong kong . according to the information from the government 's security branch , the past three years saw two cases of violation of the criminal law in hong kong by members of the british garrison . while the number is insignificant it reflects the reality that there are chances members of the military forces committing offences in hong kong . therefore , the concerns that the people of hong kong have expressed over the jurisdiction of hong kong courts in relation to the garrison are justified . under the existing military law of china , all criminal acts committed by the pla , whether they occur within or outside the barracks , are dealt with by the military court of the army even when civilians are involved . the association for democracy and people 's livelihood ( adpl ) thinks that in the light of the " one country , two systems " concept and the unique circumstances of the hong kong sar , the system governing the stationing of military forces in the territory should be duly revised to allay the worries of the hong kong people so that the system will be more readily accepted by the people of hong kong . in this connection , the adpl is of the view that the chinese military law should not be applied to the hong kong sar . in the event of future breaches of law by members of the pla stationed in hong kong , so far as the offences involve not only members of the garrison , but also civilians or people not belonging to the garrison , the hong kong courts should have jurisdiction over such cases . with regard to civil jurisdiction , when members of the present british garrison get involved in a civil case and the suing local party wishes to file a civil claim against the persons concerned , it must be filed through the courts in britain , and if the local party wins the case , the british government will make the necessary compensation . given the differences in the legal systems of china and hong kong , the adpl thinks that when members of the pla stationed in hong kong are involved in a civil case and the hong kong party intends to file a civil lawsuit , the latter should be allowed to institute a legal proceeding in hong kong courts without having to do that in mainland china . if the hong kong party is awarded compensation , it should be paid by the chinese government . as for criminal and civil cases which only involve members of the pla , the adpl thinks that they should be referred to the military court of china for action rather than tried in hong kong courts so as to avoid adding to the case load of the hong kong courts . the basic law expressly provides that public order and disaster relief are the internal affairs of hong kong . but it is stipulated in article 14 of the basic law that " the government of the hong kong special administrative region may , when necessary , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief . " this provision specifically indicates that the right to initiate a request for assistance should rest with the hong kong sar government . therefore , the garrison law should contain a provision to this effect . as regards the specific procedures , the future legislature of the sar can legislate on its own to make the relevant rules . the garrison law should also provide for the ways to build a co-operative relationship between the garrison and the sar government . the status of the sar government should be on a par with the headquarters of the pla stationed in hong kong after 1997 over matters relating to defence . both sides should establish a partnership based on mutual respect and co-operation in accordance with the basic law and the garrison law to fulfill the task of maintaining the social stability of the hong kong sar . the adpl suggests that the future sar government and the headquarters of the garrison should set up a co-ordination subgroup to serve as a standing communication mechanism . in the event of redeployment or military exercises involving the garrison , the sar government should be informed and consulted through the subgroup beforehand to ensure co-ordination between both sides . the subgroup can also play a co-operative and co-ordinating role when the sar government requests for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief . moreover , the adpl urges the chinese government and the future sar government to enhance communication and contacts between the garrison and the people of hong kong through the co-ordination subgroup . our specific suggestions include the regular opening of the barracks of the pla for public visit ; and the mobilization of members of the pla to take part in such social services as fund raising for the community chest . the adpl is of the view that communication should be strengthened between the two sides to foster the image of the garrison . a good relationship between the garrison and the general public is advantageous for the better discharge of the defence duties by the garrison . lastly , mr president , the adpl thinks that the roles taken up by the two motions today should , in fact , be reversed . that is , the amendment of the honourable ip kwok - him should be moved as the original motion whereas the motion of dr the honourable anthony cheung should be taken as the amendment . it is because the motion of dr cheung made some specific proposals on how the forthcoming garrison law should give effect to the provisions under article 14 of the basic law . in fact , the most ideal priority list is for members of this council to firstly focus only on debating the specific proposals made by dr cheung and come up with a local mainstream opinion so that the specific suggestions by the people of hong kong on the garrison law can be reflected to the chinese government . if we simply put forward a counter - proposal , suggesting in the amendment that the basic law should be implemented and then reproducing the entire text of article 14 of the basic law , it is by no means a good proposal on which a beneficial and constructive debate can be conducted . for the above reasons and considering the fact that the adpl itself is supportive of the basic law , we will abstain on the amendment of mr ip kwok - him and support the original motion of dr anthony cheung . i so submit . mr cheung man - kwong : mr president , when the hong kong people think of the chinese people 's liberation army ( pla ) , what comes to their minds is not the pla 's glorious image of liberating china but its role as the accomplice during the june 4 massacre . besides , since the economic reform and liberalization policy in china , the privileges , corruption and profiteering by the military as well as the aggressiveness and poor military discipline of the pla have also left an extremely bad image in the minds of the hong kong people . therefore , if we are to seek the truthful words of the hong kong people , they are : it would be best that the pla is not stationed in hong kong . if there is to be a garrison , the number of soldiers should be the fewer the better . in case a pla soldier breaks the law , it is most important that he should be dealt with by the laws of hong kong . there should not be any military law or military court outside the hong kong legal system that can override the laws of hong kong . what are the laws of hong kong ? first of all , it is the basic law . in the basic law , the provisions about the garrison forces to be stationed in hong kong are very brief and unclear , leaving a very large grey area and loophole . we must attach great importance to this , otherwise the hong kong people can hardly set their hearts at ease . as the saying goes : when the hong kong people encounter the pla , there will be no understanding at all despite all the reasoning and the law . the first major question is about the jurisdiction of the hong kong legal system over the pla to be stationed in hong kong . the basic law only emphasizes that the pla has to abide by the national laws and the laws of hong kong . however , it does not clearly state whether pla soldiers who violate the law outside the barracks are to be tried by the courts of hong kong or not . last year in the embassy district of beijing , there was a shooting incident by a pla soldier . although the people injured or killed were members of the public and embassy staff , the case was handled by the military court . will this situation also occur in hong kong ? under the principle that sovereignty and military powers are supreme , will the military court of the hong kong garrison deprive the hong kong courts of their jurisdiction ? this may result in a military vacuum in the rule of law in hong kong so that the pla can bypass the hong kong courts , thus overriding the laws of hong kong . hong kong is a place under the rule of law . all people , whether soldiers or civilians , are equal before the law . if the " two systems " in the principle of " one country , two systems " is taken to mean two different legal systems functioning separately , the independent rule of law in hong kong will vanish , thus running against the undertaking in article 2 of the basic law that hong kong can have independent judicial power . the second major question concerns the relation between the chief executive and the commander of the garrison forces in hong kong . should the army be under the command of the administration or should there be a separation between the army and the administration ? the basic law provides that the hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) government can ask for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief . however , once the pla is mobilized , should it be under the command of the chief executive of the sar or should it obey the commander of the garrison ? and when the task is accomplished , who can decide that the pla should return to their barracks immediately ? can the commander of the garrison , in the name of national defence but without the consent of the sar chief executive , take the initiative to suppress any acts that are regarded by the central people 's government as contrary to national security ? will the sar chief executive have the veto power to call off an operation of the pla ? all these questions will eventually come down to whether the chief executive has the power to restrain or command the operations of the garrison forces in hong kong . if the chief executive does not have this power , then there will be two power systems in hong kong . such problems will not be that prominent in normal days . but conflicts will surface in time of crisis . the central government may , in the name of national defence , tread on the " high degree of autonomy " of hong kong and thus run against the undertaking in article 2 of the basic law that the sar can enjoy a high degree of autonomy and executive power . the third major question is the formulation and implementation of the sar garrison law . according to annex iii of the basic law , there are only six national laws to be applied in hong kong . however , the garrison shall abide by not only the laws of hong kong , but also the national laws , including the sar garrison law due to be enacted . will there be any conflict between the garrison law of the future sar and the laws of hong kong ? will the sar garrison law override the laws of hong kong and become part of the national laws to be applied in hong kong ? when drafting the sar garrison law , will they only consult the preparatory committee but not the hong kong people ? in the course of applying the garrison law of the sar , will the future legislature of hong kong be totally devoid of any room to discuss and to participate ? what should be considered together with the garrison law are the existing laws governing the british armed forces . the authorities concerned will have to consider how to adapt the latter and rationalize them for the purpose of application . many of the privileges that britain used to enjoy are already outdated and even look absurd . for instance , members of the british forces not stationed in hong kong can enter hong kong without the permission of the hong kong immigration department . the british armed forces in london are thousands of miles away from hong kong and so it is not easy for them to come here . but the pla forces in shenzhen are only across the river from hong kong and it is too easy for them to come here and go . so although it is the same law , if we simply retain the privileges of the british garrison , this will give rise to a very large loophole and confusion . therefore , while adapting the laws governing the british armed forces , the authorities concerned should also rationalize them so that they can accommodate the features of the time , the place and the people . otherwise , things will be very rigid and absurd . the amendment moved by the honourable ip kwok - him is basically a repetition of article 14 of the basic law . however , the three major loopholes in regard to the aspects of enforcement and interpretation of the article , as well as the misgivings and anxiety of the hong kong people towards the pla have not been touched upon at all . if we disregard public sentiments but only repeat the article , this is another kind of rigidity . mr president , with these remarks , i support the original motion of dr the honourable anthony cheung . mrs elizabeth wong : mr president , as a peace - loving person , i would welcome any peace - loving presence of anyone , including the pla . some time ago , it was widely reported that pla armed forces were paid a pittance . i think their average wage , as reported in the media , was hk $800 a month . now , i hope my honourable friends with the ears of those in the corridors of power in china will persuade the chinese authorities to pay pla a decent salary . i hope too that they are paid a hong kong cost - of - living supplement to enable them to live a decent life when they are posted here . now , this will also enable them to enjoy hong kong when they are here and will also , no doubt , endear them to hong kong people with their conspicuous consumption . it might also minimize chances , however unlikely , of them succumbing to temptation . now , with these words , i would like to say that , like my good friends here , please rest assured that i shall myself welcome pla with an open mind and if i still have my freedom , despite my contrarian views , i shall welcome them with open arms as well . with these words , i support the motion . mr yum sin - ling : mr president , the hong kong people in general are no longer strangers to the term " people 's liberation army " ( pla ) . however , not everyone today will try to contemplate why the pla is so called . the returning of hong kong to china in fact offers a very good opportunity for the pla to do some " liberation " work , to " liberate " the hong kong people from " colonial rule " . therefore , all those things , including the privileges and exemptions given to the british garrison for defending the " colonial rule " that should not exist in the governing of fellow countrymen , should be abolished . in other words , only those provisions contained in the constitution of the people 's republic of china and the laws derived from it that seek to entrust certain special powers to the pla can be applied in hong kong . the pla should not take over the privileges of the british garrison in hong kong simply because the british garrison is now enjoying them . on the contrary , they should be " liberated " so that the pla can be worthy of its name or the name of the " red army " . the " red army " should adhere to the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention constantly advocated by chairman mao during the era of the jinggang mountains . the first rule of discipline is : " obey orders in all your actions " . pla soldiers should not think that since they are in the hong kong special administration region and away from the mainland , orders from the central authorities can be ignored . the second rule of discipline is : " do not take a single needle or piece of thread from the people " . pla soldiers must not accept any benefits . the third rule of discipline is : " turn in everything captured " . pla soldiers should not run businesses . in regard to the eight points for attention , the spirit is simply not to do anything harmful to the people and not to take advantage of them . therefore , the pla 's surrendering of certain privileges enjoyed by the colonial british forces is a manifestation of the great tradition of the " red army " , a rejection of imperial colonialism , and a contribution to helping the general people to become the masters of their own affairs . the commander of the british forces in hong kong reports to the governor and so the british garrison will not interfere in the political affairs of hong kong . but this mechanism will cease to exist in the future . in order to prevent any impermissible behaviour among the pla soldiers , the chinese central authorities should arrange that the political commissar or the secretary of the party committee of the pla stationed in hong kong be placed under the working committee for hong kong . meanwhile , with the garrison law being drawn up by the basic law committee , i believe that this can generally replace the existing mechanism that the army is subject to the control of the civil officialdom . mr president , with these remarks , i support the motion of dr the honourable anthony cheung . mr paul cheng : mr president , i find myself experiencing a disquieting feeling of deja vu as this council is once again locked in a debate that serves little or no practical purpose . article 14 of the basic law makes it very clear that the pla garrison will not interfere in local affairs , and that in addition to abiding by national laws , members of the garrison will have to abide by the laws of the hong kong sar . by moving this debate merely serves to stir up unwarranted suspicion and mistrust and create uncertainty over hong kong 's future in the minds of the potential international investors around the world . it also serves to create the wrong type of newspaper headlines , also around the world . i am quite sure that no debate took place when the british garrison first took up their position in hong kong . with less than a year to go before hong kong returns to chinese sovereignty , it is high time we devoted our time and efforts to reassuring our fellow citizens so that we can all work for a brighter future . it is already after 2 am and i am glad we are heading for a summer recess . so , please keep our remarks brief , and i do support the honourable ip kwok - him 's amendment . thank you , mr president . mr albert ho : mr president , the subject of the debate today is the stationing of chinese people 's liberation army ( pla ) garrison in hong kong . i recall that around 1983 and 1984 when the sino - british joint declaration was not yet promulgated , to maintain the confidence of the hong kong people in " one country , two systems " , mr ji pengfei , director of the hong kong and macau affairs office ; mr huang hua , minister of foreign affairs ; and mr geng biao , minister of defence , respectively told hong kong people that it was not necessary to station a chinese garrison in hong kong . at that time , quite a number of community leaders and members of the public in hong kong also agreed with that view . however , once mr deng xiaoping , the great leader of china , said that geng biao and huang hua talked nonsense and that the central government had to station military forces in hong kong to manifest china 's sovereignty , his words have since became an ironclad decree . the hong kong people immediately shut their collective mouth and did not discuss this issue any further . today , we have to take this opportunity to discuss this issue again . under the circumstances of hong kong today , is it necessary to have a garrison in the hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) for jurisprudence , security and even national defence reasons ? in fact we can push this issue a bit further . can sovereignty be manifested only when there are military forces stationed in each and every city , province and county ? it may be argued that a garrison can serve a definite defence purpose . but is hong kong all along a military port which has significant defence and strategic value ? now , as we can see , even the british garrison does not have a very substantive and important function in hong kong . as a matter of fact , many of the duties that the british servicemen used to perform in hong kong were already taken over by local police . therefore , i think that hong kong people should not say that it is unnecessary to review the pla garrison issue today or hereafter . secondly , if the garrison in hong kong is mainly for the manifestation of sovereignty , that means its function is mainly symbolic . in my opinion , hong kong people need very much a guarantee that the pla will neither intimidate hong kong people with its military power nor suppress dissidents with a view to securing political or social control . mr president , although article 14 of the basic law clearly stipulates that the pla garrison cannot interfere in the local affairs of the sar , and that it is only upon the sar 's request to the central government that the pla can assist in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief , we have to emphasize that the provision in article 14 of the basic law must be substantialized by hong kong 's own legislation in order to have a clear policy objective . that means members of the garrison cannot interfere or take part in politics , cannot interfere in the local affairs of hong kong on national defence grounds , and cannot use the excuse of defending national security to arrest in hong kong those who they think are spies or people undermining national security . the mechanism whereby the sar asks for garrison assistance should be clearly stipulated in law , making it explicit that the pla garrison will only provide assistance upon the request of the chief executive of the sar , and that such request of the chief executive must be endorsed by the legislature . if the legislature has different opinions , the chief executive should withdraw that request . the central government can only direct the pla garrison to start its assistance operation after receiving the request from the sar government . and the form of assistance should be decided by the sar government to tie in with the other policies implemented locally . mr president , whether the pla garrison will enjoy privileges in hong kong has already caused much concern among the public . we emphasize that the garrison must abide by the laws of hong kong . in particular , when the acts of members of the garrison affect the rights or freedoms of hong kong people , resulting in civil or criminal liability , they must be tried in the courts in hong kong . members of the garrison must absolutely not refuse jurisdiction of the courts in the sar for national defence reasons or in the name of executing the acts of state . although it is not written in the basic law and the laws concerned that members of the pla garrison are forbidden to run businesses in hong kong , i opine that the central government should formulate a policy to clearly spell out this . as we all know , members of the pla running businesses in the mainland has already been a matter of concern among the public . many people even doubt or query that the special status of the pla may engender special influence , thus leading to corruption , degeneration and the like . mr president , we think that the garrison law should be a local law . therefore , it should be enacted by the local legislature instead of being one of the national laws enacted by the central government for hong kong under article 18 . the reason is very simple . it is because the garrison law concerned is not a law applicable in the whole country , nor is it commonly applicable . it is specifically applied in hong kong . therefore , it should be enacted by the legislature of the sar . in view of the above reasons , we hope that members can support the original motion moved by dr the honourable anthony cheung . thank you , mr president . mr allen lee : mr president , the sitting today is the last one of this session . the motions moved by members from the democratic party in these three consecutive sittings are all about china . as a matter of fact , there is a clear message here , and that is : how much do we trust china . in regard to the garrison law , dr the honourable anthony cheung suggests that the opinions of hong kong people should be taken into account . however , a different picture emerges after other members from the democratic party spoke . for instance , the honourable cheung man - kwong highlighted the special status of the chinese people 's liberation army ( pla ) . the honourable albert ho said that corruption prevailed within the pla and queried how they would obey military orders as they were lawless . therefore , whatever garrison law it is in fact will mean nothing to these members . they are only taking this opportunity to put over their ideas : what if there is a garrison law ? do they enjoy any privileges ? mr president , i was interviewed by a japanese reporter recently about the future of hong kong . he specifically asked whether hong kong people were afraid of the pla being stationed in hong kong and why did the pla have to be stationed in hong kong ? i found his question very strange . why did he only ask this question , coming all the way from japan ? he said that he heard a lot of stories about the pla , like they would exercise their privileges in hong kong and in particular , under nobody 's control , they would be lawless . he asked whether the pla was so dreadful , and whether they should be stationed in hong kong ? first of all , i told him that the british garrison has been stationed in hong kong for years and no one has ever queried whether they should be stationed in hong kong . besides , a large proportion of the cost incurred in maintaining the british garrison has been shouldered by us . on the other hand , the pla garrison will be stationed here not just to manifest china 's to sovereignty , it also has to be responsible for the defence of hong kong . i told him that we would not have to bear the military cost . he was very surprised at the generosity of the central government to hong kong people in not requiring us to pay for the military cost . he found it really strange when i said that we did not have to share any military cost . i asked him if anybody had ever told him this . he answered in the negative and said that he had only been told that the sole purpose of the pla garrison in hong kong was to carry out suppression . whenever anything unusual happened , they would suppress . that was the impression he got . i found this very regrettable . i said to him , " you are a japanese . when the japanese started the second world war , invaded china and slaughtered several hundred thousand chinese in the nanjing massacre , were the japanese troops highly disciplined ? they obeyed the orders of their commanding officers and slaughtered the nanjing residents . the nanjing massacre is a piece of history that cannot be denied . do we chinese have to hate the japanese to the very marrow of our bones for life and seek to revenge ? if we chinese are to take revenge , what are you , japanese going to do ? " after listening to my words , he apologized to me and said that he had been misled by some people that the purpose of stationing the pla garrison in hong kong was to carry out suppression . i said , " we chinese are very broadminded . the second world war was already in the past . if we bring up the past again and go on blaming the japanese , what will you as a japanese feel ? " therefore , i think that as members of the legislative council ourselves , we should as a matter of course be concerned about future issues , but we should not give alarmist talks . in regard to whether the pla troops will break the law in hong kong , i believe that there is such a possibility . however , it is also possible for british servicemen stationed in hong kong to commit offences here . they should abide by military discipline . i have , on quite a number of occasions , met some pla troops . they are all very young and disciplined . but of course , they should not enjoy any special status . the armed forces stationed in hong kong , in particular , should not enjoy any privileges . in regard to their conduct , there must be legal restrictions . article 14 of the basic law states clearly the duties of the pla garrison stationed in hong kong and stipulates the responsibilities of the garrison . it says that in addition to abiding by national laws , members of the garrison shall abide by the laws of the hong kong sar . why does the basic law have this provision ? it is because when the basic law was first drafted , some hong kong people were quite uneasy whether the garrison should abide by the laws of hong kong . after consultation , this provision was eventually written into the basic law . in my opinion , the question at the present moment is not only a question about the pla , but also about our attitude towards our future , as well as our attitude towards china , our future sovereign state . no matter how well written the garrison law will be , it can by no means solve the psychological problems of hong kong people . if the pla garrison stationing in hong kong is only , just as what the japanese reporter said , for carrying out suppression , then we will not have to say anything at all , as whatever we say will be useless . the stationing of the pla garrison in hong kong is not simply an expression of sovereignty , it is in fact necessary for it to be stationed here . this is china 's obligation , to be responsible for hong kong 's defence affairs . when anything really happens in hong kong , the chief executive can ask the garrison for assistance . this is provided very clearly in the basic law . therefore , i think that this is not a question about the pla . what we have been debating in these few weeks is actually only the question on whether we have confidence in the future of hong kong as well as in the future of china . mr ambrose lau : mr president , the basic law was finalized after four years and eight months of drafting , during which discussions were held here and in beijing , a number of public consultations were conducted and , according to the opinions obtained , amendments were made to the draft basic law . statistics show that more than 100 amendments were made to the draft basic law , more than 80 of which are substantive amendments , and of which more than 50 were made as a result of the opinions collected by the consultation committee . this should reflect that the chinese government had truly listened to the opinions collected from all quarters in the public consultations during the formulation of the basic law . not only did the chinese government openly canvass the opinions of hong kong people in the formulation of the basic law , it did the same in preparing the establishment of the hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) . for instance , in the formation of the selection committee , the selection committee sub-group under the preparatory committee conducted a large - scale consultation exercise in hong kong in order to fully collect opinions from all quarters before the composition of the selection committee was finalized . for other giant infrastructure projects such as the new airport , the sewage programmes and western corridor railway which need the commitment of the future sar government , the chinese government has also paid attention to making extensive consultations in hong kong . when formulating the law governing the garrison in the sar , the chinese government will of course consult hong kong people . mr president , to uphold the high degree of autonomy in the sar , article 14 of the basic law has made a number of provisions : " military forces stationed by the central people 's government in hong kong special administrative region for defence shall not interfere in the local affairs of the region . the government of the hong kong special administrative region may , when necessary , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief . in addition to abiding by national laws , members of the garrison shall abide by the laws of the hong kong special administrative region . " article 14 of the basic law is the law which the garrison in the future sar must abide by . and the chinese government , in formulating the law governing the garrison in the future sar , will also follow the stipulation in the basic law . this is very obvious . in fact , non-interference by the garrison in the local affairs of the sar is one of the important issues in the principle of " one country , two systems " . as mr zhou nan said when he was interviewed by a journalist of the time magazine , " firmly upholding the principle of " one country , two systems " is in china 's fundamental interests and only a fool will harm his own interests . " the basic law clearly states that the central government is responsible for national defence . some members are of the opinion that the garrison law should be formulated by the sar . i totally disagree with this idea which is in violation of the basic law because the people 's liberation army is under the central authorities and the garrison law should of course be enacted by the central government . mr president , this council has repeatedly debated some member 's motions urging the chinese government to do this and do that . every time i pointed out that the chinese government would inevitably regard this as interference in its sovereignt affairs . if members of this council have any suggestions regarding the formulation of policies or legislation by the chinese government affecting hong kong , they should convey their opinions through effective communication channels in the capacity of members of the public . if they so often urge or even direct the chinese government to act in certain ways in the capacity of members of the legislative council in the british hong kong government , this will not bring any benefits to the relationship between china and hong kong . mr president , with these remarks , i oppose the motion . mr andrew cheng : mr president , i did not intend to speak today , as it is already so late in the night . however , after hearing the honourable allen lee speak , mr president , i really felt very disturbed . what he , with fervent nationalism , told a japanese reporter sounded awe - inspiring in the upholding of justice , and he seemed to have said that some people had misled the japanese reporter . mr president , i wish to point out two points of absurdity in his speech . firstly , he used the british garrison for the purpose of comparison . well , let me put this to mr allen lee : after so many years of british rule , what hong kong has is a colonial government . how can we compare what the future people 's liberation army ( pla ) garrison will do with the present british garrison ? if we are to put into effect the spirit of " one country , two systems " , " a high degree of autonomy " and " hong kong people ruling hong kong " , then we must not use a colonial government for comparison and say that since we have to bear the cost of the british garrison now but not for the pla garrison in the future , we are very generously treated by our motherland . i think this has just fallen into the pitfall of an absurd reasoning . secondly , we must also not keep saying that some people have misled others . let me ask this question : is it possible for just a few democrats to mislead people when they point out that china has done something wrong ? why do you not go and find out that those who have misled others are the pla troops who carried out the massacre in the june fourth incident , and that it is the chinese government which has obstinately refused to state clearly whether or not some people actually made mistakes in the incident . if only the chinese government could come out and say that the june fourth incident was a case mishandled , that it ought to be redressed , and that the pla was misled by those who were then in power . why do we not try to think in this way ? why do we not try to think that it is this dictatorial communist party that has misled people , so that many hong kong people and even the international community have thought that something has gone wrong , instead of thinking that it is we who have misled people ? as to the remarks using words like " misleading " and " alarmist talks " made by mr allen lee , i really find it heartbreaking to hear . it is our hope that by the motion moved by dr the honourable anthony cheung , open consultation would be conducted regarding the garrison law of the pla in the hong kong special administrative region . and only by so doing can the spirit of " one country , two systems " , and " hong kong people ruling hong kong " be realized . can this be regarded as " alarmist talks " ? i hope that other members can think about it . it is not our desire in the democratic camp to be " labelled " and be described as people who make alarmist talks , and as people who mislead members of the public and the international community . some people mentioned how we looked at the future of hong kong . would it be possible that with a few remarks made by us , the community becomes uneasy ? i hope that they can think it over themselves and realize that what disturbs the community is that there will be " dictatorship by a single party " , and there will be the communist party with its paternalistic rule that permits only one voice . thank you , mr president . dr anthony cheung : mr president , on the face of it , there seems to be no conflict between the wording of the honourable ip kwok - him 's amendment and my motion , as he has merely said that he supports the chinese government 's move to formulate a garrison law for the future hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) so as to implement the provisions in article 14 of the basic law . but if that is the case , why can he not support my original motion ? why does he have to amend it ? what are the specific areas in my motion that the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong ( dab ) is opposing ? my motion contains three points , and the first point is for public consultation with the hong kong people . members from the dab said they agree that hong kong people should actively present their views , but noted that hong kong people have no right to ask the chinese government to consult them publicly on laws formulated by china . it seems that they have forgotten the fact that , when drafting the basic law that affects hong kong , the chinese government had in the 1980s consulted the views of hong kong people with " three visits to beijing and three to hong kong " . so how can one say that hong kong people have no right to ask for public consultation ? as for the chief executive 's power to request the garrison 's assistance , i have not heard views from mr ip kwok - him that are contrary to my motion . as for having the military forces stationed in hong kong to be placed under the jurisdiction of the courts of the sar , he merely said that as far as military matters are concerned , they should be dealt with according to military laws . he seemed to have forgotten the fact that the basic law provides that the courts of the sar have jurisdiction over all cases in the sar . he finally mentioned that it was his view that there was an ulterior motive for the democratic party to move this motion , and he said that our motion had gone beyond the powers of the colonial legislative council . this was also pointed out by the president of the legislative council . if the argument of mr ip kwok - him was tenable , i doubt very much why he had put forth this amendment , as the wording of his amendment goes like this : " that this council supports that the chinese government " in doing something . by the same token , he was also going beyond the powers of the colonial legislative council that he referred to , was he not ? i cannot understand this kind of logic . this is a kind of political gesture . president : dr anthony cheung , are you saying that you are making a political point and not making a point of order , so the president should not be involved ? dr anthony cheung : in fact , my original motion has proceeded entirely from the provisions in the basic law . as a matter of fact , members who have spoken , including those who criticized me , could not put forth any views that are substantively different from mine in regard to jurisdiction and the power to make request . they , including those who said would support mr ip kowk - him 's amendment , only said the democratic party harboured some motives in moving the motion , and thus only played up the issue of " motive " . the real objective of mr ip kwok - him 's amendment is to oppose public consultation on the garrison law ; it does not address the issue of jurisdiction , resulting in ambiguous wording . it is only an amendment that reflects a reluctance in stating his position , or a fear to do so . i feel that if members oppose my motion because they oppose the spirit and direction of my motion , i respect their decision . but you do not have to hide behind a vague and imprecise amendment . on the other hand , if members endorse the direction and spirit of my motion , i call upon them to oppose mr ip 's amendment . i also call upon members from the hong kong association for democracy and people 's livelihood not to refrain from opposing just because the words " the basic law " appear in mr ip 's amendment . i think if you support the spirit of my motion which happens to be also the spirit of the views you expressed , you should oppose mr ip 's amendment as a matter of procedure . thank you , mr president . secretary for security : mr president , i have listened very carefully to honourable members ' views on dr the honourable anthony cheung 's motion and the honourable ip kwok - him 's amendment . from 1 july 1997 , the government of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) will assume responsibility for the defence of hong kong . the transfer of defence responsibilities from britain to china is one of the most important aspects of the transfer of sovereignty . the handover of defence responsibilities is a challenging task for the chinese and british garrisons , and the chinese , british and hong kong governments all attach great importance to this task . first of all , i would like to mention briefly about the progress of the handover of defence lands before moving on to issues concerning the garrison and the law , and the relationship between the garrison and the government , about which all of you are very concerned . after seven years of discussions in the sino - british joint liaison group ( jlg ) , a comprehensive agreement on the future of the defence estate was reached in june 1994 . this was a significant milestone on the co-operation of the two sides on this front . since the signing of the defence lands agreement , we have intensified our contacts with chinese defence experts on various practical matters relating to the transfer of the 14 military sites and four reprovisioning projects to be handed over to the future chinese garrison . visits were organized to familiarize them with the sites that they will take over , the environment in which they will operate , and hong kong in general . progress relating to arrangements for the transfer of these " hardware " is smooth , but we have not lost sight of the importance of the " software " . by " software " , i am referring to the legal framework that will be applicable to the future chinese garrison , and the interface between the people 's liberation army ( pla ) and the government of the hong kong special administrative region ( sar ) . i would like to talk about the issue of the garrison and the related law . although article 14 of the basic law provides that " in addition to abiding by national laws , members of the garrison shall abide by the laws of the sar " , it does not set out a detailed legal framework for the future chinese garrison . as mentioned by honourable members today , this is a very urgent and important issue that concerns the public . time is running short , there are less than 360 days before the handover . mr president , the garrison and the law is one of the most important items on our policy agenda in respect of the transfer of defence responsibilities . we understand that the chinese government is drafting a garrison law to govern the operation of the pla in the sar and we have been doing all we can to help : we provided detailed information to chinese defence experts on hong kong 's legal and judicial systems , we briefed them thoroughly on the principles we at present adopt in determining criminal and civil jurisdiction over the british forces and hong kong laws affecting the military . also , we have made use of every available opportunity and channel , formal and informal , to indicate to the chinese side that we wish to hold discussions with them in order to reflect our ideas on the garrison law . we are pleased that the chinese side have expressed willingness at the 36th meeting of the jlg to brief us and to listen to our views on the issue of the future garrison and the law . although the timetable for the discussions has not yet been fixed , we hope our dialogue with chinese experts will be fruitful and constructive . some members have highlighted the need of public consultation . we entirely agree with this . although this is ultimately a matter for the chinese government , we will encourage the chinese side to be as transparent , open , and positive as possible in the drafting process of the garrison law . we are not the only ones who want to put forward ideas , and i am sure there are experts in the field in the legal profession and other sectors of the community . since the garrison law has a direct impact on hong kong people , transparency is an important element to secure general community support of this important piece of legislation . mr president , i would now like to turn to the question of jurisdiction over members of the garrison . there are clear laws and rules now : although this is a colonial rule , members of the british forces in hong kong will be tried in hong kong courts if they commit an offence under hong kong laws , unless the alleged offence : - is against another member of the garrison ; or - is against the property of the united kingdom government ; or - arises out of and in the course of their duty . in any of these circumstances , the case will be dealt with under military jurisdiction . british servicemen convicted in a local court are fined or have to serve their sentence in a local correctional institution according to hong kong law . we see no reason why these principles to determine criminal jurisdiction over hong kong 's garrison should not continue to apply after 1997 : they have been in place for a long time and regarded as fair , sensible and workable . such arrangements are also consistent with article 14 as well as article 19 of the basic law which provides that " the courts of the sar shall have jurisdiction over all cases in the region , except that the restrictions on their jurisdiction imposed by the legal system and principles previously in force in hong kong shall be maintained " . on civil jurisdiction , the british garrison is immune from suit in hong kong under the crown proceedings ordinance ( cap . 300 ) . however , claims against the british garrison are normally settled between the parties out of court . a claimant who is not satisfied with the proposed settlement may pursue his claims against the british government in the united kingdom civil courts . members of the british garrison can also be sued , as individuals , in hong kong courts . does the present situation created by cap . 300 mean that the pla can only be sued civilly in a mainland court after 1997 ? we do not think so . the present arrangement is possible because the common law system , in particular the law of tort and the law of contract , is substantially the same in hong kong and the united kingdom . we believe that after 30 june 1997 , it would be important for residents and companies in the sar to be able to pursue civil cases against the chinese garrison in accordance with the common law . this would require such cases to be heard in sar courts rather than prc courts which operate under a different legal system . we believe that this approach will not only be welcome by the community , but is also consistent with articles 8 , 14 , 18 and 19 of the basic law . i also heard that some members mention the question of legal provisions under which the british garrison enjoy certain powers and exemptions , and some people think that these are privileges . recently , i explained to the security panel of the legislative council the detailed provisions , therefore , i will not repeat here . however , i must emphasize that the so - called privileges offered to the british forces are not for individual interests . they are just to enable the british forces to carry out their duties effectively and legally in their capacity of the garrison in hong kong . when the british forces provide assistance to the hong kong government , their power cannot exceed the scope strictly defined by hong kong laws . since the chinese garrison is different from the british garrison , we have to carefully scrutinize all relevant laws to see whether they are applicable to the future garrison . we will process the laws in the context of localization . we shall submit proposals on localization of all hong kong laws to the chinese side through the jlg and we would like the chinese government to give us feedback on localization of such laws as soon as possible . in addition , article 14 of the basic law should be observed when the future chinese garrison is exercising any law enforcement power and many members have already mentioned this point . article 14 of the basic law provides that in addition to abiding by national laws , members of the garrison shall also abide by hong kong laws . in hong kong , there is a culture that we are very concerned about the problem of corruption and we are not specifically referring to any forces or other people . we strongly oppose corruption , and naturally , we also believe hong kong laws should also include laws that will be effective in the sar and relating to bribery and corruption . lastly , i would like to turn to the interface between the garrison and the sar government . some members are worried that the future garrison may interfere in the internal affairs of the sar government . this is explicitly prohibited by the basic law . article 14 of the basic law provides that " military forces stationed by the central people 's government ( cpg ) in the sar for defence shall not interfere in the local affairs of the region . " the basic law also explicitly states that the sar government shall be responsible for maintaining pubic order and the garrison can only assist in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief when the sar government makes a request to the cpg . the primary role of the british garrison is to provide a tangible demonstration of british sovereignty . although the british forces do not have similar constraints as those laid down in article 14 of the basic law , they render assistance only when requested by the government . the last time that the british garrison was called upon to assist the government in maintaining public order was in 1967 . but even then , the police were at the front line and the military only played a supporting role . with the strengthening of our security forces to take over the functions and capabilities of the british garrison in the past 30 years , notably the taking over of border patrolling by the police in 1992 , we do not envisage the need to request the assistance of the pla . the hong kong police and other law enforcement agencies and emergency services are staffed , equipped , and trained to deal with any conceivable internal security problem which might arise . some members have suggested that detailed guidelines and procedures be drawn up for the sar government to follow when requesting assistance from the pla . to enhance public confidence and to ensure that the requirement of article 14 of the basic law is complied with , it would be desirable to set out clearly the channels through which such requests may be made by the sar to the cpg during unusual times . this matter will have to be dealt with by the cpg , the pla , and the sar . certainly , the prerequisite is all the mechanisms and channels must operate effectively , in order to deal with unforeseen situations where human life , property and the stability of hong kong is at stake , and the arrangement should be acceptable to hong kong people . this council and the community are concerned about the future legal framework under which the pla will operate , and are keen to ensure that such framework is in line with the spirit of " one country , two systems " , " hong kong people ruling hong kong " and " a high degree of autonomy " . we believe that the chinese government is fully aware of the sentiment of hong kong people on this issue and we have also reflected this sentiment to the chinese government time and again . it is hoped that the chinese government would do more to provide assurances to them that the commitments under the joint declaration and the basic law are met . on our part , we will do everything we can to contribute to this process . thank you , mr president . question on the amendment put . voice vote taken . the president could not determine from voice vote . president : council shall proceed to a division . president : i would like to remind members that they are now called upon to vote on the question that the amendment moved by mr ip kwok - him be made to dr anthony cheung 's motion . will members please register by pressing the top button and then proceed to vote by choosing one of the three buttons below . press " present " first . president : members please check their votes . are there any queries ?

obviously , the basic law has provided for certain basic principles governing the stationing of military forces in future . therefore , if those provisions are adequate , the present discussions on the formulation of the garrison law of the hong kong special administrative region in future would be unwarranted . among the arguments put forth by members who are either opposed to or critical of my motion , i cannot find any substantive comments on or objections to my motion . they are merely surmises about a conspiratorial motive of the democratic party in moving this motion , alleging that we are creating fear and a confidence crisis . in fact , who are the ones that lack confidence ? if they have confidence , why can they not debate the substance of my motion ? my motion made a reference to jurisdiction and the principle that " the civil court takes precedence " . why are these principles undesirable ? i fail to hear any argument from the speeches of members who hold views different from mine . the honourable yum sin - ling made a good point ( but he was not here in the vote just now ) . he is of the view that hong kong should be liberated from the colonial framework under the british rule and that the people 's liberation army ( pla ) should not simply inherit the practice of the british garrison . from what those members who are critical of my motion said earlier , i heard a very worrying message and that is , we could follow exactly what the british did previously and there was nothing wrong with it . in fact , my motion only seeks to further broaden the existing stipulations in the basic law . just now the honourable ambrose lau also mentioned that during the drafting of the basic law , many people in the community expressed anxieties and a diversity of reservations about the pla and hence , the basic law was written in its present form . this can , to a certain extent , reflect the concerns at that time . then , are members of the public afraid of the pla ? in fact , that the chinese government decided to adopt a closed management approach in the stationing of military forces has indicated something . anyhow , my motion today does not aim for a discussion on whether the community is afraid of the pla . it is meant to identify ways to impose , in accordance with the law , control on the role , duties and behaviours of the pla in hong kong in future . although the amendment of the honourable ip kwok - him is carried , the democratic party urges members who are supportive of my original motion to oppose the motion as amended by mr ip kwok - him . question on dr anthony cheung 's motion as amended by mr ip kwok - him put . voice vote taken . the president could not determine from voice vote . president : council shall proceed to a division . president : members may wish to be reminded that they are called upon to vote on the question that the motion moved by dr anthony cheung as amended by mr ip kwok - him be approved . will members please first register their presence by pressing the top button and then proceed to vote by choosing one of the three buttons below ? president : before i declare the result , members may wish to check their votes . we are two short of the head count . are there any queries ? still one short of the head count . are there any queries ?

" mr lau chin - shek : mr president , i move the second reading of equal opportunities ( family responsibility , sexuality and age ) bill as set out in the order paper . in 1948 the general assembly of the united nations adopted the universal declaration of human rights . it says , in article one , " all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . " today , i believe no one in our community will openly oppose the concept of equal opportunities . i think the spirit of equal opportunities is based on the belief that all human beings are born equal and each of us should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . and legislation against discrimination of any form is recognition of equal opportunities and equal rights in a concrete way . for this reason , legislation on equal opportunities must embrace all areas . it should not be any piecemeal legislation which forbids certain discriminatory acts but at the same time permits the continued existence of others . a former legislator , ms anna wu , in an effort to legislate against all forms of discrimination , introduced a comprehensive equal opportunities bill two years ago on the basis of this belief . unfortunately , the government 's response was quite conservative . under the pressure of this council and the public , the government enacted legislation against sexual and disability discrimination last year . but at the same time , it spared no effort to defeat miss wu 's bill involving other areas of equal opportunities . last year , the equal opportunities bill was voted down and honourable colleagues who supported equal opportunities vowed to revive it this year . we will honour our promise in this council today and introduce a comprehensive package of equal opportunities bills . the three bills on equal opportunities which is introduced for first and second readings today represent the determination of the honourable mrs elizabeth wong , the honourable miss christine loh , miss emily lau and myself in pushing for legislation on equal opportunities . the bill for which i am responsible concerns discrimination due to family responsibility , sexuality and age . i hope discriminatory acts relating to these areas can be prohibited through legislation , thus enabling the victims of discrimination to have an opportunity to appeal so that protection for equal opportunities can really be put in place . the government has tried every means to avoid legislating on equal opportunities . besides lobbying members of this council , the government also tried to employ the delay tactic of " consultation " . it even firmly resisted legislation against discrimination in some areas on the pretext of public disagreement . however , i hope the government will clearly understand that the purpose of any legislation on equal opportunities is to protect the vulnerable . so it is not a question whether it is supported by the majority or not . legislation for protecting the victims ' rights is necessary whenever there are vulnerable people and discrimination . in fact , legislation against discrimination does not mean that you have to accept any particular group of people . its purpose is to eliminate discrimination so that they can enjoy equal rights , like you and me . i believe a society in which people treat each other like brothers and sisters will be a society in real peace and harmony . i hope members will support comprehensive legislation on equal opportunities on the basis of this belief . with these remarks , mr president , i move the second reading of this bill . thank you . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . equal opportunities ( race ) bill mrs elizabeth wong to move the second reading of : " a bill to promote equality of opportunity in hong kong and to provide remedies in respect of discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , nationality , national or ethnic origin , or involving racial harassment . " mrs elizabeth wong : mr president , i move that the equal opportunities ( race ) bill be read the second time . the purpose of this bill is to render discrimination on the ground of race unlawful and to make provision for relevant remedies . the objective is to eliminate , as far as it is possible , all forms of racial discrimination in hong kong . in doing so , the bill also intends to give effect to a variety of international obligations applicable to hong kong via this piece of domestic legislation . many in hong kong maintain that race relations are not a problem in this beautiful city . if this were true , then the passage of the bill would be no big deal for any of us , and would therefore be very appropriate . if not , then it would be all the more necessary to support this bill so as to appreciate the true value of social integration and cohesion in hong kong in our effort to remove racial prejudice . mr president , the bill has six parts and i shall highlight some of the key areas , seriatim below . part i sets out the objects of the bill in detail to assist in interpretation . in particular , it provides that the definition of race includes colour , descent , ethnic , or national origin and nationality . because the principal purpose of the bill is to give effect to certain international instruments , the interpretation should be consistent with the standards under these international obligations . part ii deals with discrimination on the ground of race . it includes the workplace ; it covers both direct and indirect discrimination and makes discrimination unlawful in such areas as education , access to places , services , facilities , and so on . it also prohibits discrimination in the form of racial vilification . part iii defines other unlawful acts , including victimization and certain advertisements . part iv provides for general exceptions to the bill , for example , where race is a genuine occupational qualification for dramatic and artistics roles that demand racial authenticity and for services to promote the welfare of a particular race . part v provides for implementation and enforcement . discriminatory acts or practices made unlawful by the bill are civil wrongs and triable in the district court . part vi sets out miscellaneous matters and provides for rules of liability . it removes an anomaly by amending the hong kong bill of rights ordinance to make it applicable to all legislation , not merely to legislation invoked by the government or public authorities . mr president , we know from historical facts that when a society is sensitive to the needs of all groups in its midst , including those of minority groups , the result is social harmony . hong kong is an open , progressive and dynamic society where people of different race , colour and creed live in peace and harmony . yet , here and there , you might see example of unfortunate racial prejudice which tarnishes hong kong 's image . many countries around the world have all encompassing anti-discrimination laws . i believe that full participation in all spheres of activities by the people of hong kong , of whatever race , is the true meaning of hong kong people governing hong kong . those who love hong kong are not necessarily only those of ethnic chinese origin . equal treatment of all groups of people in society will establish the effectiveness of a cohesive society . thus , the recognition and enjoyment , by all peoples , on an equal footing , of human rights include fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural and any other field of public file . these rights must be promoted and protected . equal opportunities for all will enrich our society with diversity . we should be able to share our cultural uniqueness through offering equal opportunities for all as we progress into the next century . history tells us that prejudices of any kind can become potentially destructive and divisive . so , in race relations , let us race towards the sun . mr president , this bill is , in fact , no stranger to this council . in 1994 , then legislator , the honourable ms anna wu , attempted to introduce a similar bill which revisits this council today . i commend this bill to this council . thank you , mr president . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . mass transit railway corporation ( amendment ) bill 1996 mr sin chung - kai to move the second reading of : " a bill to amend the mass transit railway corporation ordinance and its subsidiary legislation . " mr sin chung - kai : mr president , i move that the mass transit railway corporation ( amendment ) bill 1996 be read a second time . the mass transit railway corporation ( mtrc ) is a commercial organization solely owned by the government . it is a public body set up under the mass transit railway corporation ordinance in 1975 and section 6 (2) ( f ) of that ordinance empowers the mtrc to decide on the structure of fares by itself . therefore , as the situation stands , so long as the board of directors of the mtrc has decided on a certain rate of increase , all it has to do is to inform the executive council in order to put it into effect . this autonomy in deciding fares is not enjoyed by other privately - owned public transport companies . the purpose of the bill is to set up a mechanism to regulate the adjustment of mtr fares so that the legislative council , as an elected institution , can scrutinize the fares of the mtr that affect people 's livelihood . after the bill is passed , any proposal to increase the fares of the mtr has to be passed in the form of subsidiary legislation in the legislative council before it can be put into effect . at present , the government has different ways to regulate the privately - owned public transport companies , but it has adopted a complete laissez - faire policy towards the mtrc and the kowloon - canton railway corporation , the two big government - owned transport companies . this is really unfair . under the existing laws , any adjustment of the fares of the four franchised bus companies has to be approved by the executive council and any application for fare increase by the franchised ferry companies , the hong kong tramways and the taxis has to be approved by the executive council and the subsidiary legislation concerned has to be laid on the table of the legislative council which may , according to the interpretation and general clauses ordinance ( cap .1 ) , amend the decision of the executive council by means of a resolution where necessary . therefore , giving the legislative council the power to regulate the fares of the mtr is only consistent with the existing government policy of regulating fare increases of public transport companies . as the railway network continues to expand , the mtr has become the main transport lifeline in the urban areas of the territory and the public has become increasingly dependent on it . in order to protect the interests of the community and to ensure that the mtrc will set its fares at a scale which is reasonable and acceptable to the public , any increase of its fares should be regulated by the legislative council . the mtrc has all along expressed that it is reasonable to increase its fares at a rate which follows the inflation rate closely . however , i have proposed this motion because i think that the fare and charge increase by public utilities should be flexible . besides the operational and financial conditions of the companies themselves , the economic situation of society and the ability by the public to afford the fares and charges should also be considered . however , experience tells us that even when the mtrc is earning huge profits , it has still insisted on increasing its fares every year . it has not considered the rate of increase from the community 's point of view at all . although the fare increase of the mtr has often been opposed by members and the public , people have no choice but to accept it because the fare increase of the mtr is not regulated at all . one thing which makes people even more angry is that the mtrc has ostensibly claimed that its rate of fare increase follows the inflation rate on average , while in fact it has substantially increased the fares . for example , this year , the mtrc has substantially increased the fares for the long trips at a rate as high as 13.6% and has a low rate of increase for the short trips , resulting in an average rate of increase of 6.9%. however , in fact , 77% of the passengers will have to bear an increase of fares ranging from 7% to 13.6%. it is apparent that if the mtrc has autonomy in deciding fares , the interests of the public will be neglected . the legislative council is really duty - bound to regulate the public utility companies on behalf of the public . after the bill is passed , it does not mean that the legislative council will necessarily oppose or refuse any proposal of fare increase by the mtrc . if the mtrc has sufficient and reasonable grounds to increase its fares , the legislative council will certainly not vote against its application for fare increase unreasonably . the purpose of the bill is only to give the legislative council and the public the authority to regulate the fare increase of the mtrc in the future and to further protect the interests of the public . mr president , i sincerely hope that members of this council will support the bill . with these remarks , i move that the bill be read a second time . thank you . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . kowloon - canton railway corporation ( amendment ) bill 1996 mr sin chung - kai to move the second reading of : " a bill to amend the kowloon - canton railway corporation ordinance and its subsidiary legislation . " mr sin chung - kai : mr president , i move that the kowloon - canton railway corporation ( amendment ) bill 1996 be read a second time . just like the mass transit railway corporation , the kowloon - canton railway corporation ( kcrc ) is a commercial organization solely owned by the government . through the kowloon - canton railway corporation ordinance ( kcrco ) , it became a public corporation in 1982 . section 4 (2) ( e ) of the kcrco empowers the kcrc to determine at its own discretion the fares of kcr , light rail transit ( lrt ) as well as the fares of its feeder bus service in the lrt service area in northwest new territories . therefore , once the board of directors of the kcrc has decided the rate of increase , it only needs to inform the executive council and the new fares can be implemented . the purpose of the bill is to establish a mechanism to regulate fare increases made by the kcrc , so that the legislative council as an elected institution can scrutinize the fares of kcr , lrt and the lrt feeder bus service , which affect people 's livelihood . after the bill is passed and implemented , whenever the kcrc wants to increase its fares , the new fares have to be approved by the legislative council in the form of subsidiary legislation before they can be implemented . in view of the fact that the circumstances regarding this bill are similar to the mass transit railway corporation ( amendment ) bill 1996 , i therefore do not intend to repeat the arguments . in order that the government 's current policy of regulating public transport fare increases is fully implemented so as to protect the people 's interests and to ensure that the kcrc is charging fares that are reasonable and acceptable to the public , i sincerely hope that members of this council will also support this bill . mr president , with these remarks , i move that the bill be read a second time . thank you . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . sex and disability discrimination ( miscellaneous provisions ) bill 1996 miss christine loh to move the second reading of : " a bill to make further and better provision for the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of sex , disability , marital status and pregnancy ; of sexual harassment ; and of harassment and vilification of persons with a disability or their associates . " miss christine loh : mr president , i move the second reading of the sex and disability discrimination ( miscellaneous provisions ) bill 1996 . this bill is one of three member 's bills introduced today on the subject of equal opportunities . taken together , these three bills revive the legislative project that was launched in 1994 by former legislator , ms anna wu 's equal opportunities bill . our project is to give the community comprehensive and effective legislation against unfair discrimination . the sex and disability discrimination ( miscellaneous provisions ) bill makes important improvements to the existing sex discrimination ordinance , and makes several parallel amendments to the disability discrimination ordinance . almost all the amendments contained in the bill were recommended last year by the bills committee that met weekly for many months to study those two ordinances before they were enacted . many of the amendments also implement suggestions made by the united kingdom equal opportunities commission , on the basis of more than a decade of experience with closely similar laws . the bill 's amendments help victims of sex and disability discrimination , and also promotes equal opportunities generally . the ordinance , as it stands , is badly flawed . its flaws reflect the ulterior purpose for which it was originally put forward by the administration : not to combat discrimination , but to control and contain pressure to legislate against discrimination . so far , the ordinance has effectively served that ulterior purpose . it helped the administration defeat ms anna wu 's bill last year , and it has provided a handsome screen for government inertia and delay ever since . it has now been the phantom ordinance for more than a year , on the lawbooks but without any legal effect in the community . when the administration finally brings it into effect �0�0 whenever that may be �0�0 it will force victims of discrimination to negotiate a minefield of exceptions and limitations to their rights . of many examples , i will mention only the ordinance 's wholly arbitrary $150,000 cap on damage awards for employment discrimination . now is the time to take this important ordinance away from the administration and make it serve the community as it should . this bill will do so , and i recommend it to members . question on the motion on the second reading of the bill proposed . debate on the motion adjourned and bill referred to the house committee pursuant to standing order 42 ( 3a ) . resumption of second reading debate on bill the hong kong institute of landscape architects incorporation bill resumption of debate on second reading which was moved on 13 march 1996 mr edward ho : my thanks go to all members who have been

report of changes to the approved estimates of expenditure approved during the third quarter of 1988-89 public finance ordinance : section 8 financial secretary : sir , in accordance with section 8 (8) ( b ) of the pubic finance ordinance , i now table for members ' information a summary of all changes made to the approved estimates of expenditure for the third quarter of the financial year 1988-89 . supplementary provision of $264.7 million was approved . this included $151 million for the purchase of water from china . the provision was fully offset either by savings under the same or other heads of expenditure or by the deletion of funds under the additional commitments subheads . approved non-recurrent commitments were increased by $74.9 million during the period , and new non-recurrent commitments of $276.5 million were also approved . in the same period , a net increase of 1 361 posts was approved . items in the summary have been approved either by finance committee or under delegated authority . the latter have been reported to the finance committee in accordance with section 8 (8) ( a ) of the public finance ordinance . report of the police complaints committee 1988 dr. tse : sir , on behalf of the police complaints committee , may i table the committee 's annual report for 1988 . the committee is an independent group appointed by you , sir , to monitor and review the investigation of complaints by the public against the police . this is the third report compiled by the committee since its establishment in 1986 to take over the work previously carried out by the former umelco police group . sir , i am pleased to report that the number of complaints has continued to drop . in 1988 , 3 230 complaint cases were registered by the complaints against the police office ( capo ) of the royal hong kong police force . this represented a 16.9 % decrease over the 3 885 cases registered in 1987 and a 28.9 % decrease over the figure of 4 544 in 1986 . through the support of an independent secretariat , the committee had been able to vet in detail each and every complaint case processed by the complaints against the police office . during the year under report , the committee had reviewed a total of 3 516 complaint cases including cases carried over from 1987 , embracing 5 451 allegations . in the process of vetting and endorsing these complaint cases , the committee had proposed a number of reviews of , and changes to , police practices , procedures and instructions . it is hoped that the committee 's proposals would help to improve the overall effectiveness of the complaints system and assist the commissioner of police in identifying and rectifying areas which were perceived as conducive to the generation of public complaints . arising from these complaint cases , various forms of legal , disciplinary and internal action had been taken and advice given against 1 210 police officers in 1988 . however , these figures should be seen and interpreted in the light of at least 3.3 million potential police - public confrontation situations , including 1.9 million persons stopped and checked through the police operational nominal index computer system ( ponics ) and 1.4 million traffic summonses and tickets issued by the police , in the same year . the difficult nature of the front - line duties , which the police are tasked to perform to protect the community , should be borne in mind . having said this , the committee would like to pledge its continued determination to safeguard the integrity of investigations into complaints against the police and to exert its utmost to be worthy of the trust that you , sir , have placed in the committee . i would like to take this opportunity to thank all the government departments concerned , in particular the commissioner of police and all officers in his complaints and internal investigations branch for the co-operation and assistance rendered to the committee and its secretariat . i would also like to record my appreciation of the contribution and support by members of this council . thank you . green paper on transport policy in hong kong secretary for transport : sir , i have much pleasure to introduce today the green paper on transport policy in hong kong . it sets out for public consultation a long - term strategy to keep our transport system moving into the 21st century . transport does more than moving people and goods . it links the family and the individual to economic , social and recreational activities . it is , above all , essential to the continued prosperity and dynamic growth of hong kong . i should first emphasize that the publication of the green paper should not be seen that there is a need to change the basic principles of our transport policy . these basic principles , first set out in the 1979 white paper , have stood the test of time . they are : first , to improve the transport infrastructure ; second , to expand and improve public transport ; and third , to make more economic use of the road system . nevertheless , it is useful from time to time to take stock of past progress and to review future strategy . this is why we commissioned the second comprehensive transport study ( cts - 2 ) in 1986 to project growth in transport demand up to 2001 , and to appraise transport infrastructure and policy options to meet future challenges . the green paper was prepared based on the cts - 2 findings . continuous forward planning is the key to our success in coping with the rapid growth in transport demand . for example , between 1976 when the first comprehensive transport study was undertaken and 1988 , our vehicle fleet increased by 75%, public transport patronage by some 65% and the total volume of travel more than doubled . the government remains committed to a comprehensive and long - term infrastructure building programme . most of the projects recommended by the first study in 1976 have now been completed . the road and rail projects for the next 10 years outlined in this green paper will require an estimated total investment of $29 billion . these are tailored to meet the anticipated need for linking the new towns and the urban areas , and providing additional harbour crossings and cross border routes . but we simply cannot build ourselves out of congestion . road and rail construction has become more expensive and difficult . now we often have to reclaim land , build tunnels and elevated roads to improve our road network . this is borne out by the fact that four major tunnels will be completed progressively between now and 1991 . also , we cannot build indiscriminately , as consideration will need to be given to preserving and improving our environment . our public transport system has been and will continue to be one of the key elements of our transport strategy . indeed , we have a public transport system that is second to none in providing a comprehensive network , with a wide choice of modes at reasonable fares . despite heavy congestion at peak hours , it is still easier to travel around in hong kong than london , tokyo and many other cities . the basic philosophy of our public transport system is that the operation of different modes should be carried out on commercial lines by private sector or by public corporations operating on commercial lines , with the government providing a statutory framework , monitoring and co-ordination . the inter - modal co-ordination policy will continue to be the basis for maintaining a balanced and efficient system . this maintains a good range of public transport services ; encourages the use of off - street modes ; keeps travelling cost low and gives due weight to consumer comfort and convenience . the policy will continue to be applied flexibly to meet changing demands and developments . but again , no matter how many roads we build and how much we improve our public transport services , the problem of road congestion at certain places and times of the day will remain . this is simply because the demand for road use far exceeds the road capacity . this calls for effective management measures without which vehicular traffic could overload the infrastructure . this would impede the smooth flow of goods , seriously undermine the efficiency of road - based public transport and hold up emergency vehicles such as ambulances , fire - engines and police cars . looking ahead , hong kong 's transport problems are becoming increasingly complex and solutions are subject to rising cost and physical constraints . economic success also generates an enormous demand for goods movements . the rapid growth in recent years of cross border goods vehicle traffic imposes further strains on the road network . the need to manage the growth of goods vehicle traffic is obvious , but the measures should be aiming at minimizing any adverse effect on the economy . at the same time , increasing affluence generates a natural demand for high quality means of travel and car ownership . this calls for constant upgrading of public transport services , and management measures which aim at more efficient use of road space . the green paper tabled today sets out a wide range of possible measures to achieve more effective use of road space by giving priority to the more efficient and essential road users , and managing travel demand to a level with which the road system can cope . the need for and the consideration of the options for better management of road use must be viewed alongside the mammoth task of keeping hong kong moving . in the past 20 years , hong kong has emerged as a major world centre of industry and finance . in total gross domestic product , hong kong now ranks 42nd in the world out of 211 nations ; when just 10 years ago we ranked 60th . there are now 324 000 licensed vehicles , or about 230 vehicles for every kilometre of road , one of the highest densities of traffic anywhere in the world . in fact , we have more commercial vehicles per kilometre of road than most other countries have total vehicles per kilometre . the total patronage of public transport is fast approaching 10 million boardings per day . yet most of these activities are concentrated into a built - up area of less than 100 square kilometres , containing some of the highest density residential areas in the world . some congestion is inevitable . the task before us is to keep it within acceptable limits in terms of time and cost to the community . of course , better co-ordination of land use and transport planning will help reduce the pressure on the transport system . this means , for example , locating employment opportunities close to residential areas , placing port and freight terminals near ware - houses and industries , and reducing the density of land development . these issues are being addressed in other studies such as the metroplan and harbour reclamations , and require the closest and fullest co-operation between transport and town planners . but the tackling of traffic congestion is not just a government effort . the community can and should play an active part in reducing peak hour congestion by , for example , supporting a greater use of flexi - time and staggered working hours . the government is keen to explore any such methods to reduce the need for regulation and restraints . thus one of the main purposes of this consultation is to find out how the community can help and what practical incentives government can provide to bring this about . sir , the green paper on transport policy only sets out possible alternatives in tackling the transport problems over the next 10 years . the government needs public views to help determine the practicability and acceptability of these alternatives and fully welcomes any suggestions on other options . i hope that the green paper will generate full and constructive discussion and debate over the next four months so that a balanced transport strategy in the overall interest of hong kong can be finalized . motions hong kong export credit insurance corporation ordinance the financial secretary move the following motion : he said : sir , i move the first motion standing in my name in the order paper . in february 1988 , the maximum contingent liability of the hong kong export credit insurance corporation was increased from $4,200 million by $800 million to $5,000 million . since then , the corporation 's liability under contracts of insurance has risen at a rate of about $130 million per quarter . as at 31 march 1989 , the figure stood at $4,682 million . in addition , there is potential commitment in respect of new policies and policies pending renewal totalling $152 million , leaving only $166 million for new business . given this rate of increase , the corporation 's advisory board estimates that the existing statutory limit may be reached shortly . it is therefore recommended that the maximum contingent liability ceiling be increased by $1,000 million to $6,000 million . failure to raise this limit could result in the corporation having to turn away further business and hence to discourage our exports . i would like to stress that the maximum liability is a theoretical contingent amount . it is never likely to be at risk as a whole at any one time . sir , i beg to move . question on the motion proposed , put and agreed to . telephone ordinance the financial secretary moved the following motion : " that with effect from 1 june 1989 , the schedule to the telephone ordinance be amended -- ( a ) in part i by adding after item 7 ( b ) -- he said : sir , i move the second motion standing in my name in the order paper . section 26 (2) of the telephone ordinance gives this council the power to amend , by resolution , the schedule to that ordinance of maximum charges that may be levied by the hong kong telephone company . charges for line rentals and installation , and other miscellaneous charges were last increased , by resolution of this council , with effect from 1 october 1985 . at that time , members were informed , based on projections then available , that a further round of increases would not be required until early 1988 . it has been possible to delay these increases by over a year as a result of higher than expected sales , and improved productivity and operating efficiency on the part of the company . it is worth noting that over the past 10 years , telephone tariffs have risen by less than half the rate of inflation . in february , the company submitted an application to increase its tariffs by an overall average of 7% in order to meet increased operating costs , to maintain its high standard of service and to keep pace with growing demand . the application has been thoroughly examined and the items in the resolution now before this council are considered to be justified . the major items are the increases in exchange line rental charges . the effect on ordinary business and residential subscribers will be modest : the monthly cost of an ordinary exchange line for business use will be increased from $66 to $70 , and for a residential exchange line from $43 to $48 . the proposed increase in the monthly rental charge for a standard telephone from $5 to $6 a month to cover the cost of an upgrading programme is significant in percentage terms . in monetary terms , however , the $1 a month increase is modest . the present charges of $72 per annum for the rental of an internal extension , and of $100 for the connection and change of " starline " features are to be abolished . the resolution proposes that the new charges , the first increases for over three and a half years , should take effect from 1 june 1989 . based on current projections , there is unlikely to be any requirement for further increases until 1991 . sir , i beg to move . at this point , mr. david li declared his interest as a director of the hong kong telecommunications company . question on the motion proposed , put and agreed to . first reading of bills animals and plants ( protection of endangered species ) ( amendment ) bill 1989 control of exemption clauses bill 1989 peak tramway ( amendment ) bill 1989 road traffic ( amendment ) bill 1989 immigration ( amendment ) bill 1989 immigration ( amendment ) ( no .2 ) bill 1989 ozone layer protection bill 1989 temporary control of density of building development ( kowloon ) bill 1989 bills read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to standing order 41 (3) . second reading of bills animals and plants ( protection of endangered species ) ( amendment ) bill 1989 the financial secretary moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the animals and plants ( protection of endangered species ) ordinance . " he said : sir , i move that the animals and plants ( protection of endangered species ) ( amendment ) bill 1989 be read a second time . the purpose of this bill is to prohibit trade in medicines containing rhinoceros derivatives or ingredients , to tighten control on trade in endangered species in general and to increase the maximum fine to provide the necessary deterrent . the animals and plants ( protection of endangered species ) ordinance and its schedules were enacted in 1976 , giving effect to the 1973 convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) , to which hong kong is a party through ratification by the united kingdom . the existing legislation provides for the control of trade in live specimens and readily recognizable parts and derivatives . it does not , however , adequately cover rhinoceros derivatives or ingredients in certain chinese medicines . it is therefore necessary to take action to prohibit trade in medicines containing such ingredients in order to comply with our obligations under cites . in addition , the bill seeks to introduce additional provisions on transit , identification of specimens , powers of search , forfeiture and disposal of live and perishable specimens in order to facilitate the enforcement of the ordinance . the bill also introduces new fines of $10,000 for giving false information to obtain a licence and making false claims in respect of scheduled species and controlled medicine as a deterrent . as to the existing fines , which were fixed in 1976 , the bill seeks to increase them five fold to restore their deterrent effect . the proposed amendments have been drawn up in close consultation with the endangered species advisory committee . we have consulted also the trade associations representing importers and vendors of traditional chinese medicines . they have voiced no objection to the proposed ban provided sufficient time is given for the disposal of existing stock . we will ensure that sufficient advance notice is given before the prohibition on rhinoceros ingredients comes into operation . sir , i move that the debate on this motion be adjourned . question on the adjournment proposed , put and agreed to . control of exemption clauses bill 1989 the attorney general moved the second reading of : " a bill to limit the extent to which civil liability for the breach of contract , or for negligence or other breach of duty , can be avoided by means of contract terms and otherwise ; and to restrict the enforceability of arbitration agreements . " he said : sir , i move that the control of exemption clauses bill 1989 be read the second time . the bill is concerned with those exemption clauses in contracts and notices which seek to exclude liability for negligence or breach of contract . the bill closely follows the recommendations of the law reform commission 's report on the control of exemption clauses . this report was published in december 1986 and recommended that legislation be introduced in hong kong based on the english unfair contract terms act 1977 . the bill , if enacted , would have a significant effect on the law of contract and of negligence . sir , i would like to pay tribute to the thoroughness of the work carried out by the law reform commission and its sub-committee , chaired by mr. arjan sakhrani , q . c ., on this very important and complex subject . the law reform commission consulted widely before publishing its report and the administration has carried out further consultation with the major chambers of commerce , major business associations and the legal profession . in certain areas some associations have expressed concern about effects of the proposal on their business but the general response is favourable . exemption clauses are often used to exclude or restrict liability for breach of contract or negligence . they are sometimes used to deny a person 's legitimate rights and expectations , for example , where one party in a strong bargaining position imposes on a weaker or less sophisticated party a clause excluding liability for negligence . the law reform commission concluded that the use of exemption clauses leads to abuse , particularly where the parties to a contract do not have equal bargaining strength . the commission believed that the benefits of some measure of control outweighed any economic disadvantages which may be caused by this limited interference with the freedom of contract . i would like to summarize the main features of the bill . part ii , which is the heart of the bill , provides that certain types of exemption clauses are automatically ineffective and certain other types are subject to a reasonableness test . the four types of clauses that are automatically ineffective are those that cannot , under any circumstances , be justified . they are as follows : first , an exemption clause relating to death or personal injury resulting from negligence . for example , there are notices displayed in some children 's playgrounds purporting to exclude liability for injuries caused by the negligence of the playground operator . there can be no justification in that , or any other situation , for denying a person a remedy for injuries caused by another person 's negligence . the bill will , therefore , put an end to the unfairness caused by such clauses . secondly , an exemption clause in a guarantee of consumer goods . at present , many so - called " guarantees " in fact take away greater rights than they give and are therefore traps for consumers . the bill will prevent guarantees operating in this way . thirdly , a clause in a contract for the sale of goods excluding the seller 's liability for selling goods which did not belong to him . it is considered unfair for any buyer to have to bear the loss caused by such a wrongful act of the seller and , in this respect , the bill replaces a provision that already exists in the sale of goods ordinance . fourthly , a clause in a consumer contract for the sale or supply of goods excluding the supplier 's liability if the goods are defective or do not correspond with the contract description . the bill here protects only parties who are consumers , since where a person obtains goods in the course of business , there may be situations in which it is reasonable for him to take the risk of the goods being defective . the sale of goods ordinance already contains a provision to this effect in relation to sales and the bill extends the protection to supply contracts , for example , contracts of hire and hire - purchase agreements . the types of clause that are subject to a reasonableness test are those that may or may not be justifiable depending on all the circumstances of that case . for example , such a clause may be legitimate as between parties who are legally advised and who deal at arm 's length , but may be quite unfair as between a large company and consumer who simply signs a contract form without reading it . the bill enables the court to determine the effectiveness of such a clause in a flexible manner . the test of reasonableness applies to the following types of exemption clause . first , a clause purporting to exclude liability for loss or damage ( other than death or personal injury ) resulting from negligence . for example , a clause by which a surveyor of property purports to exclude liability for a negligent survey . given the infinite variety of circumstances in which such a clause could exist , it cannot be said that such a clause would in all cases be unjustified , even against a consumer . an automatic ban on such clauses is not therefore thought appropriate . secondly , a clause which excludes liability to a consumer for breach of contract . such clauses clearly operate against the interests of consumers and ought to be controlled . thirdly , a clause in a contract made on written standard terms which excludes liability for breach of that contract by the party who prepared those terms . the inclusion of this type of clause within the reasonableness test will protect not only consumers but also businessmen who accept written standard terms of contract offered to them . the absence of negotiation , which is often a feature of such contracts , and the fact that small businesses are often in no stronger bargaining position than consumers , suggests the need for such protection . fourthly , a clause in a non-consumer contract for the sale of goods excluding liability in respect of the quality of goods , and a clause in a non-consumer contract for the supply of goods excluding liability in respect of the title to or the quality of the goods . businessmen are again protected by the inclusion of this type of clause within the reasonableness test . there is thought to be a need for this since the small businessman may be forced to obtain goods subject to such a clause and also because , if he supplied those goods himself to a consumer , he would be unable to exclude his own liability in respect of those goods . the reasonableness test also applies to two types of clauses which , though not in law exemption clauses , have a similar effect to exemption clauses . the first type is a clause which purports to entitle a party to a contract not to perform any obligation under the contract , or to perform it in a way that was substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him . for example , a tour agent arranges a cruise for a person on one ship but provides , in conveniently small print , that if that ship is fully booked the person must accept the cruise on another ship . the bill provides that this type of clause is subject to the reasonableness test if it is used against a consumer or by a party contracting on his own written standard terms of business . the second type is a clause by which a consumer promises to compensate another person in respect of that other person 's liability for negligence or breach of contract . an example of this is found when a valet parking service includes a term requiring the owner of the car to indemnify the supplier of the service if the driver negligently damages property belonging to a third party . this type of clause will be once again subject to the reasonableness test . in applying the test of reasonableness , the courts are required in all cases to have regard to the language in which the terms are expressed . in relation to contracts for the supply of goods , the bill specifies other matters to which the court must have regard , including the strength of the bargaining position of the parties to the contract ; whether the customer received any inducement to enter the contracts and whether the customer knew or should have known of the existence of the exemption clause . the bill would also prevent arbitration clauses from being enforced against a consumer unless the consumer consented to its enforcement after differences had arisen , or the consumer had recourse to arbitration in pursuance of the agreement . the administration supports the use of arbitration by parties to a contract who consciously choose that method of dispute resolution in the knowledge of all its implications . however , in the case of a consumer contract , it is possible that the consumer agreed to an arbitration clause either without knowing of its existence or without realizing its implications . the consumer may then discover that it is much more costly for him to refer a dispute under the contract to arbitration than it would be for him to refer it to the courts . for these reasons the administration supports the recommendation of the law reform commission that arbitration clauses in consumer contracts be subject to a form of control . sir , there are a number of types of contract that are excluded from certain statutory controls . perhaps the most important of these are contracts relating to insurance , and to the creation or transfer of an interest in land . contracts relating to insurance have been excluded on the basis that the insurance industry has proposed a scheme of self-regulation relating to insurance contracts . such a scheme could have greater advantages for consumers than inclusion of the insurance industry within the scope of this bill , because of the special nature of insurance contracts . the industry 's proposals are now being considered by the administration and it is hoped that the arrangements will be completed within this year . exemption clauses in conveyancing documents have been excluded because of the need for certainty . those contemplating purchasing property should always seek legal advice . however , it should be noted that exemption clauses relating to matters which are preliminary to the purchase of buildings will be subject to the controls in the bill . sir , this bill is technical and complex . if it is enacted , we intend to delay implementation for at least 12 months , so as to allow the business community to consider their use of contracts and to make any necessary amendments . the technicalities of the bill should not blind us to its social significance as a major piece of consumer protection legislation . the bill seeks to achieve fairness while at the same time minimizing uncertainty , and i commend it to this council . sir , i move that the debate on the motion be now adjourned . question on the adjournment proposed , put and agreed to . peak tramway ( amendment ) bill 1989 the secretary for transport moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the peak tramway ordinance . " he said : sir , i move the second reading of the peak tramway ( amendment ) bill 1989 . the main purpose of the bill is to require the peak tramways company ltd. to run and operate the tramway in compliance with the safety requirements stipulated by the government . before going into the details of the bill , i would like to describe briefly the background leading to the present amendments . in september 1988 , the government further extended the franchise of the peak tramways company ltd. to run and operate the tramway for 10 years , with effect from 1 january 1994 . this is subject to the commitment of the company to embark on a major modernization scheme for the tramway . the modernization works of the tramway , approved by the governor in council under sections 4 and 5 of the peak tramway ordinance and started since may , will conform to the latest international standards for funicular railways and will involve substantial changes to the tramway system including the haulage equipment , the control and signalling system , and the design of the tram - cars . legislative amendments to the peak tramway ordinance are now required to ensure the safe operation of the modernized tramway , which will be inaugurated in august this year . the opportunity is also taken to update the ordinance . turning now to the main points of the bill . clause 4 provides that under new sections 14 and 14a , the tramway shall be designed and constructed with due regard to safety and in accordance with a code of practice to be issued by the government . under new sections 14b and 14c , the secretary for transport can appoint inspectors to test and examine the tramway , to ensure its safety and to investigate accidents . new sections 14d and 14e empower the secretary for transport to direct the company to remedy defects on the tramway or order the full or partial closure of the tramway for safety reasons . under new section 14f , the company may close or partially close the tramway for repairs and alterations but must notify the secretary of any such closure forthwith . new section 14g increases the maximum penalty for wilful interference with the tramway from the present fine of $100 to $5,000 and imprisonment for six months . under new section 14h , an employee of the company commits an offence if negligence in his work endangers or is likely to endanger safety on the tramway . the maximum penalty will be a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for six months . clause 5 of the bill provides for the making of subsidiary legislations , including safety regulations and by - laws to cope with the modernized tramway . clause 6 stipulates that whilst the company may continue to fix its own fares , monthly tickets will continue to be issued to regular commuters at a charge not exceeding 25 times the standard adult single journey fare . clause 7 provides that the authority of the governor in council under the ordinance to approve the technical matters of the tramway will be delegated to the secretary for transport . with these amendments , the safe operation of the modernized tramway will be ensured so that members of the public and tourists may continue to enjoy this very popular recreational and transport facility for hong kong in improved safety and comfort . sir , i move that the debate on this motion be now adjourned . question on the adjournment proposed , put and agreed to . road traffic ( amendment ) bill 1989 the secretary for transport moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the road traffic ordinance . " he said : sir , i move the second reading of the road traffic ( amendment ) bill 1989 . the purpose of this bill is to empower the commissioner for transport to designate driver training schools and to regulate their operation . there is at present no legislation governing such schools and the driving course contents . indirect control is imposed through the lease conditions on two driving schools now operating on leased sites on government land . however , such control is not adequate . if an operater chooses to operate a driving school on private land , even such indirect control cannot be exercised . as a result of government 's policy to encourage off - street driver training , more learner drivers are now taking their lessons in driving schools . in 1987 , some 34 000 or 24% of learner drivers attended driving schools . this figure rose to 37% or over 56 000 last year . regulations will be made to require learner motor - cyclists to undertake basic mandatory off - street training in driving schools before they are allowed to practise on the streets . with the introduction of this requirement , more driving schools are likely to open . it is therefore necessary to establish a proper legal framework to authorize the commissioner for transport to designate driving schools and to regulate their operation . this bill empowers the commissioner to designate driving schools for a maximum period of five years upon receipt of a designation fee and to lay down conditions regarding the necessary requirements , procedures and standards . these include the content and duration of driving courses , driver training facilities , and safety measures and equipment . the commissioner is also authorized to specify the tuition fees for mandatory off - street motor - cycle and motor tricycle training , and to inspect designated driving schools . if an operator is in breach of the conditions for designation or any relevant legal provisions , the commissioner may revoke the designation . but the operator will be given the right of appeal to the transport tribunal to review the commissioner 's decision . sir , i move that the debate on this motion be adjourned . question on the adjournment proposed , put and agreed to . immigration ( amendment ) bill 1989 the secretary for security moved the second reading of : " a bill to amend the immigration ordinance . " secretary for security : sir , i move that the immigration ( amendment ) bill 1989 be read a second time . in the first four months of this year , nearly 4 500 illegal immigrants have been arrested , an average of 38 a day . some have succeeded in obtaining employment during their stay in hong kong . the bill seeks to make it easier to bring a successful prosecution against those who employ illegal immigrants . clause 4 of the bill makes it clear that labour inspectors have the authority to require an employer to produce for inspection the record of his employees . if the employer is suspected of having employed illegal immigrants , labour inspectors will be empowered to seize evidence to substantiate this , such as the record of employees . the employer will be entitled to take a photocopy of the record for his retention , and will be given a receipt for the original . if the employer is not present during the inspection of a place of employment , clause 5 of the bill will enable a labour inspector to require production of the records within 72 hours by notice in writing served on the employer . clause 3 of the bill will enable evidence that a person is not lawfully employable to be brought by means of a certificate signed by the director of immigration . this will avoid the need for lengthy detention of illegal immigrants simply for the purpose of enabling a prosecution to be brought against an employer . finally , clause 2 of the bill makes it clear that holders of two - way permits issued by the chinese government are not lawfully employable in hong kong . sir , i move that the debate on this motion be now adjourned . question on the adjournment proposed , put and agreed to . immigration ( amendment ) ( no .2 ) bill 1989 the secretary for security move the second reading of : " a bill to amend the immigration ordinance . " he said : sir , i move that the immigration ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1989 be read a second time . the purpose of this bill is to establish new refugee status review boards to consider and decide objection from vietnamese asylum seekers against an initial decision to refuse them refugee status . since the implementation of screening in june 1988 , over 20 000 vietnamese boat people have arrived in hong kong . of these some 1 600 have been screened . refugee status has been granted to 165 persons . the remainder have been refused refugee status . under the law as it stands , vietnamese boat people who have been refused refugee status may object against that decision to the governor in council . so far , all those refused refugee status have lodged objections against the decision . it has been apparent for some time that the number and complexity of the cases makes it unreasonable and impractical for the governor in council to be involved in determining objections . moreover , unless and until we can complete the entire screening and objection process , we are unlikely to be able to achieve repatriation on any appreciable scale . the administration has , therefore , reviewed the present screening and appeal procedures , with the aim of completing the process within 12 months for all outstanding cases and three months for all new arrivals . this re-estimate will require completion of the entire process for 400 persons per week . dedicated , full - time review boards are necessary to achieve this objective . the bill therefore provides for asylum seekers from vietnam to have , in place of the present right of objection to the governor in council under section 53 of the immigration ordinance , a right to apply to have their cases reviewed by a refugee status review board . i should like at this stage to say a few words about the composition and method of operation of the boards of review . it is intended that there will be one chairman of all the boards . he , as well as the deputy chairmen and other members of the boards , will be appointed by the governor . they will include non-officials . in practice , each board will consist of the chairman , or a deputy chairman , and one other member . the practice and procedure of the boards will be as prescribed by regulations by the governor in council . in considering objections , a board will act in an administrative capacity . it will be entitled to take into account any information or material at its absolute discretion , and to confirm or review the first instance decision as it thinks fit . its decision shall not be subject to appeal or review . in addition , the bill also seeks to make some minor amendments to the immigration ordinance to clarify some of the existing provisions relating to vietnamese boat people . i should now like to turn to the legislative proposals themselves . clauses 4 and 5 of the bill will introduce two new sections to the immigration ordinance . section 13f will provide for the review of an initial decision to refuse refugee status by a refugee status review board , while section 13g provides for the establishment of such boards . clause 2 ( b ) will provide that persons detained under section 13 ( d ) of the ordinance are not to be treated as ordinarily resident in hong kong . this clarifies the status of vietnamese boat people during their stay in hong kong . section 13a of the immigration ordinance as it stands enables children born outside vietnam to former residents of vietnam to be permitted to remain in hong kong as refugees . at present the detention of such children is authorized under the general provisions of the ordinance . clause 3 ( a ) of the bill provides that in future the detention of such children shall be authorized under section 13d (1) , the section under which former residents of vietnam are themselves detained . clause 3 ( b ) will provide for written notice of determination in a form specified by the director of immigration to be served on asylum seekers . notice may be given to the asylum seeker in person , or by displaying it in such a manner that it may conveniently be read by him . clause 6 of the bill will provide that outstanding appeals which have yet to be submitted to the governor in council will be considered by the refugee status review boards . sir , it is intended that the new arrangements should be brought into operation before the middle of june , as soon as regulations prescribing the practice and procedures of the refugee status review boards are approved by the governor in council . it is for this reason that i am asking members to agree that all stages of the bill should be taken at today 's meeting of the council . sir , i beg to move . question on second reading proposed . mr. cheong : sir , i rise to support the immigration ( amendment ) ( no . 2 ) bill 1989 . the purpose of this bill is twofold . first , it seeks to speed up screening procedures on vietnamese boat people . second , it seeks to set up a number of specialized appeal boards to handle more efficiently subsequent appeals made against the screening results . the decision to streamline existing procedures is essential to cope with the increasing number of boat people arriving in hong kong . afterall , the success of repatriation , be it voluntary or mandatory , depends upon the efficient handling of screening and appeal procedures . i would like to emphasize again that the administration should seek to secure international acceptance of mandatory repatriation as quickly as possible . it is clear to all of us that most boat people now arriving in hong kong , or indeed other places of first asylum , are economic migrants rather than genuine refugees . mandatory repatriation is a crucial element in the successful implementation of the screening policy . the bill provides that an appellant will not have the right to be present or be legally represented when his case is reviewed by the appeal boards . in spite of the fact that hong kong is genuinely sick and tired of the vietnamese boat people problem , we still need to try our best to uphold those principles that we treasure in our system and therefore i urge that , as far as practicable , a suitable number of legally qualified persons should be appointed to serve on the boards . this will ensure that the appeal cases can have the necessary input from the legal profession . in addition , lay persons other than civil servants should as far as possible be recruited to serve on the boards . my colleagues have suggested , for example , that the help of justices of the peace and district board members could be solicited . i do realize that it may not be possible to recruit lay persons to fill all positions on the boards but it is important in my view to ensure that membership of the boards fully reflects their ability to function impartially . sir , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr. martin lee : sir , the people of hong kong have demonstrated by their recent actions their firm commitment to upholding human rights and the rule of law . but the rule of law does not mean rule by any law which those in power might choose to enact . for the rule of law is meaningless unless the laws we pass in this council are fair and just . sir , human rights and the rule of law are universal values . they apply to all including unwanted visitors such as vietnamese boat people . the immigration amendment ( no . 2 ) bill 1989 provides that neither the applicant nor his representative be entitled to be present when his case is reviewed by the refugees status review board . it also provides that the board when considering any review shall act in an administrative or executive capacity and that the board is not required to give any reason for its decision which shall not be subject to review or appeal in any court . the bar association and the law society have expressed their disquiet both at the content of the bill and at the speed of its proposed passage . i join them in deprecating the provision that neither the applicant nor his representative may be present at the review . it is in clear breach of an important rule of natural justice that both sides should be heard : and this provision is particularly oppressive since the board 's decision is final . this bill seeks to relieve the governor in council of the tremendous burden of having to deal with thousands of appeals and seeks to create an administrative tribunal to take up these appeals by way of review . but i suppose that the review is in the nature of a re-hearing . and bearing in mind the applicant has been screened out without the benefit of prior legal assistance , is not given the reasons for the " verdict " , and is not given the right to appear before the tribunal to clarify points contained in his case for review , one really wonders how the tribunal can be expected to do justice to his case ? sir , this bill makes a mockery of the system of justice that we hold so dear . for these reasons , i am unable to support it and would strongly urge the government to reconsider it . attorney general : sir , i would like to respond to certain points made by mr. martin lee in his speech . mr. lee has made three points on which i would like to comment . he claims that the bill breaches fundamental rules of natural justice in that it denies the appellant and his legal representative an oral hearing before the refugee status review board . he also says that the appellant is not given the benefit of legal assistance and is not given the reasons for the decision of the immigration officer . i would like , if i may , to take those points . in considering the question of natural justice , it is important to bear in mind that the rules of natural justice require that there should be a fair hearing . but that does not include the right to an oral hearing , provided the appellant , in this case the person seeking refugee status , is given the opportunity to comment on the submissions on the case prepared by the immigration officer . what i have just said is a matter of settled law supported by the decisions of the courts , and to repeat it , that the right to a fair hearing does not mean a right to an oral hearing . as to the point about not being given reasons for decisions , the bill confers a regulation - making power . under subsection (5) of the proposed new section 13g , power is given to make regulations and it is intended that regulations made under that power will provide that the decision of the immigration officer , his reasons and the material on which he has based his decision will be made available to the applicant or his representative . that leads on to the third point made that the applicant , when screened out , is denied the benefit of legal assistance . the proposed new section 13f (3) says -- " in preparing his case for review under this section an applicant shall be permitted all reasonable facilities to enable him to obtain the assistance of -- ( a ) his legal representative , if he has one ; or ( b ) in any other case , a prescribed person , and such representative or person shall be afforded all reasonable facilities to enable him to render such assistance . " mr. martin lee : would the honourable member give way ? sir , i think the learned attorney general has misunderstood the point here . what i am complaining about is that the applicant has not been given legal advice before the review . his excellency the president : just very briefly please , mr. lee , on a point of clarification . mr. martin lee : sir , the point is that the applicant has not been given legal advice prior to the screening . attorney general : i am grateful for that clarification . perhaps i could continue , if mr. lee would bear with me , to make the point that i was making about the right of the applicant to legal assistance for the purposes of formulating his appeal against the decision of the immigration officer . i think , with respect to mr. lee , that that is the issue in relation to the bill . the points i was going to make are , firstly , the bill will provide the applicant with full access to his legal representative for the purposes of framing his appeal to the refugee status review board ; and secondly , as a matter of general and now settled practice , the representative will in general be an appeals counsellor appointed by the agency for voluntary services which is the unhcr 's participating agency providing assistance to those who are claiming refugee status . i should perhaps add here that i believe that many of the appeals counsellors , who have been recruited on a full - time basis by the unhcr , are indeed legally qualified . sir , the points , i think , that are important to bear in mind in considering whether or not this bill is in breach of fundamental rules of natural justice are these : first of all the bill makes full and adequate provision for those wishing to appeal to see the reasons for the immigration officer 's decision ; secondly they are given full and adequate opportunity to have access to legal advice for the purposes of framing their appeals to the refugee status review board ; and thirdly they are given full and adequate opportunity to comment on the submissions and views of the immigration officer . sir , i am satisfied that this bill does not breach the rules of natural justice as has been asserted , and i support the bill . secretary for security : sir , i am grateful to mr. cheong for his support of this bill and i agree with his remarks . in particular , i can assure him that the hong kong government will be pressing as hard as it can for the mandatory repatriation to vietnam of those found not to be refugees following screening . i accept also the point he made that there is a need for a qualified legal presence on the board . we shall be trying to obtain a qualified lawyer as chairman of the board . i accept also the need which he referred to for the presence of lay persons on the board . we shall endeavour to include suitable persons to serve on the board from outside the ranks of officials , for example , as he suggests , from the ranks of the non-official justices of the peace . question on the second reading of the bill put and agreed to . bill read the second time . bill committed to a committee of the whole council pursuant to standing order 43 (1) . ozone layer protection bill 1989 the secretary for lands and works moved the second reading of : " a bill to give effect to hong kong 's international obligations under the 1985 vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer and the 1987 montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer ; to provide for the prohibition of the manufacture of , and to control the importation and exportation of , substances that deplete the ozone layer and of products containing or made with those substances ; and to provide for related matters . " he said : sir , i move the second reading of the ozone layer protection bill 1989 . the ozone layer protects the earth and its inhabitants from the sun 's ultra - violet rays . since the mid - 1970s , scientists have observed a gradual depletion of this protective layer , resulting in harmful effects which include increases in the incidence of skin cancer , suppression of human immune responses and impeded growth of living matters . scientific research has shown that destruction of the ozone layer is caused by certain chlorine compounds , namely chlorofluorocarbons -- which are commonly known as cfcs for short -- and halons . cfcs are used in refrigeration , air conditioning , packaging , and as solvent and aerosol propellants . halons are used mainly in fire fighting . apart from depleting the ozone layer , cfcs also contribute substantially to the " greenhouse effect " on global warming . in view of the threat of ozone depletion , the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer was drawn up in 1985 to provide an international framework to address the problem . under the provisions of the convention , the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer was concluded in september 1987 , stipulating more specific controls . hong kong was party to both agreements . the montreal protocol , which only came into effect on 1 january this year , calls for a freeze and subsequent reductions in the production and consumption of cfcs and halons . signatories of the protocol have agreed to freeze at their 1986 levels the production and consumption of cfcs with effect from 1 july 1989 , and halons with effect from 1 january 1992 . the consumption of cfcs is also to be reduced by 50% over a period of 10 years . to fulfil hong kong 's international obligations under the protocol , this ozone layer protection bill was drawn up . hong kong does not produce any cfcs or halons but clause 3 of the bill provides for prohibition against the future manufacture of such substances . at the same time , we are obliged to restrict the consumptions . under provisions in the bill , all importers and exporters are required to register with the director of environmental protection and obtain a licence before importing or exporting the controlled substances . we shall first introduce control on the consumption of cfcs by putting in place an administrative quota system to ensure that the 1986 levels are not exceeded . the control of the import and export of halons will be implemented at a later stage . to ensure that registration and licensing are being implemented in a fair and reasonable manner , clause 8 of the bill provides for appeal to the governor by notice in writing addressed to the chief secretary . the bill also provides powers for the governor in council to make regulations for control of products containing or made with the controlled substances and for the use , recovery , recycling or disposal of such substances . this also provides the framework to introduce other measures as may be endorsed by the international community . sir , the restriction on import and export of the controlled substances is unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy as they constitute a very small proportion of hong kong 's overall trade . the effect on local consumers would not be great , as substitutes are already available for many cfc uses . better housekeeping and recycling can also substantially reduce dependence on cfcs . sir , i move that the debate on this motion be now adjourned . question on adjournment proposed , put and agreed to . temporary control of density of building development ( kowloon ) bill 1989 the secretary for lands and works moved the second reading of : " a bill to control temporarily the density of building development in certain areas of kowloon . " he said : sir , i move the second reading of the temporary control of density of building development ( kowloon ) bill 1989 . the civil aviation department has recently completed a review of airport height restrictions in the territory . this was initiated as a result of changes to the international civil aviation organization guidance on the construction of flight procedures , the need to tie in with new navigational aids , as well as the need to determine development height restrictions for newly formed land . the review has recommended that airport height restrictions in many areas of kowloon can be relaxed by varying degrees which may result in permitting greater density for building development . sir , notwithstanding this , the question of how to tackle the problems of development densities comprehensively in the urban areas is being addressed by the metroplan study , which is expected to be completed by the end of the calendar year and will take a further year to implement through town plans . in order that metroplan 's aims are not frustrated , or expectations of increased development potential not unduly raised , it is considered necessary to temporarily continue to limit building development densities ( where the present airport height restrictions may be relaxed ) to their presently permitted levels . clause 3 (1) of the bill therefore requires the building authority to refuse approval of building plans of buildings in these areas which exceed the presently permitted plot ratios . clause 4 , however , states that these provisions will cease to be in force by 31 december 1990 unless amended by resolution of this council . this coincides with the date by which it is expected that metroplan 's recommendations , particularly those relating to density controls , will have been implemented . these controls are designed to restrict development densities to their presently permitted levels , but will permit greater flexibility of design by allowing developers , once the present airport height restrictions are relaxed , to put up higher buildings than are currently permitted . sir , i move that the debate on this motion be adjourned . question on adjournment proposed , put and agreed to . committee stage of bill council went into committee immigration ( amendment ) ( no .2 ) bill 1989 clauses 1 to 6 were agreed to . council then resumed . third reading of bill the attorney general reported that the immigration ( amendment ) ( no .2 ) bill 1989 had passed through committee without amendment and moved the third reading of the bill . question on the third reading of the bill proposed , put and agreed to . bill read the third time and passed . member 's motion the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people ' s republic of china ( draft ) mr. allen lee moved the following motion : " that this council calls on the people of hong kong to express their views on ' the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china ( draft ) ' and urges the authorities concerned to take such views fully into account before the promulgation of the basic law . " mr. allen lee : sir , i rise to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper . seldom has a debate in the legislative council been more timely . what my honourable colleagues will say today and tomorrow in this chamber will , i hope , provide inspiration and a focus for the community in their study of the draft basic law , and assist them in coming to a view on what they want to see enshrined in the basic law , so that they can ensure that the principle of " one country , two systems " promised in the sino - british joint declaration will be adhered to , and to form a government that is truly " hong kong people ruling hong kong " . our objective in addressing the complex issues raised in the second draft of the basic law is clear : based on our experience of the present system of government , we hope to recommend to the drafters certain changes to the second draft that , in our view , will produce a workable political system that will preserve our economic prosperity and ensure our freedom , justice and democracy in the 50 years beyond 1997 . we also felt that there was a need to lay down clear objectives on major issues raised in the draft basic law so that the community could study it with a better understanding of these objectives . whilst recent events in hong kong have clearly shown that our community is not politically apathetic , we recognize that there is a need to provide people with a focus on major issues to which they can turn . it was with this aim in mind that members of the executive and legislative councils , under the chairmanship of dame lydia dunn , set out to study the second draft in detail soon after its publication . it was recognized at the outset that whilst the second draft was an improvement over the first , a number of articles as drafted remain unclear , and a number of issues left not addressed . views on these articles were often polarized , but after weeks of soul - searching and discussion , i feel really proud of my colleagues . whilst representing different interests and holding diverse and strong personal views , they have recognized the need to come together with a unity of purpose in the overall interest of hong kong . i am glad to say we have reached broad agreement on certain major issues , and agreed on various recommendations to the drafters . i will now spell out our recommendations in the major areas where we have reached agreement , and briefly explain the reasons for the recommendations . i shall concentrate on sections in the second draft of the basic law concerning the political structure of the future hong kong special administrative region . political structure ( a ) relationship between the executive and the legislature as a matter of principle , we feel that the basic law should provide for a co-operative working relationship between the executive and the legislature , and at the same time provide sufficient checks and balances against possible abuse of power by either organ of power . we feel that the model proposed in the second draft does not define this relationship clearly . the basic law model is largely based on the existing system , with the executive council being responsible for policy decisions and the legislative council being responsible for enacting legislation to support policy . however , the existing government structure has many unwritten conventions , for example , close consultation between the administration and omelco panels and legislative council ad hoc groups , overlapping membership between the executive council and the legislative council , and a wide consultation process through an extensive network of advisory boards and committees prior to the making of policy decisions by the executive council . these conventions have proved to be effective in encouraging a co-operative working relationship and we feel that these conventions should be formalized and preserved . we recommend , therefore , in relation to article 55 , that the chief executive should appoint at least half of the executive council members from among members of the legislative council . this requirement would ensure that the chief executive has reasonable support in a fully elected legislature , and that the legislature has influence in the policy making process . the members of the executive council appointed from the legislative council should help to explain and obtain support on the one hand and act as a check on executive council policy making process on the other . during our deliberations on article 65 , it was also recognized that advisory boards and committees play an important part in the decision making process , and that it is important for the legislative council members to be involved at an early stage before major policy decisions are made in executive council . this would strengthen the link between the legislature and the executive . however , in view of the large number of advisory bodies and the relatively small number of legislative council members , we feel that it is only necessary to specify that the latter should be appointed to advisory committees in major policy areas which will be decided by the chief executive in accordance with the community 's needs at the time . ( b ) formation and composition of the legislature moving on to the formation and composition of the future legislature , we agree with the intention stipulated in the draft basic law that we should move ultimately towards universal suffrage for the election of all members of the legislative council . the question is how soon . understandably , views on the timing are diverse , but in the overwhelming urge to strengthen our overall recommendations to the basic law drafters , we have agreed to support the timetable to introduce 50% directly elected seats in 1997 and 100% directly elected seats in 2003 . we have also agreed that this clear timetable is needed to provide a focus towards which the community could work , and that the referendum envisaged in annex ii of the second draft would therefore not be necessary . in considering the development towards our ultimate aim of having all members directly elected in 2003 , we have taken into account the need for orderly progression to avoid abrupt changes which could be unsettling . we have also recognized the need to retain functional constituency seats during the transition period and in the early years of the hong kong special administrative region . although these seats are indirectly elected , experience has shown that functional constituency representatives have a distinct and effective contribution to the work of the legislature , and it would suit hong kong 's unique circumstances to retain these seats until 2003 while the community prepares itself for a fully directly elected legislature . we therefore recommend that in 1997 , of the total 60 seats , 30 should be filled by direct elections and 30 from functional constituencies , that is , 50% of the seats should be filled by direct elections . in 1999 , the second term of the special administive region legislature , the number of directly elected seats should increase from 30 to 60 , while the number of functional constituency seats should remain unchanged . in this way there would be a total of 90 seats , 66% of which would be filled by direct elections . in 2003 , the third term , the number of directly elected seats should be further increased by 30 , that is , from 60 to 90 . this will make up the entire legislature , thereby achieving 100% universal suffrage . the size of the legislative council will be slightly larger than that proposed in the basic law draft in order to accommodate the changes we recommend and to cope with the workload envisaged . ( c ) selection of the chief executive i now come to an area in the draft basic law which has been much debated among members , that is , the selection of the chief executive . i refer to annex i of the second draft . only last evening did members of the executive and legislative councils come to a unanimous view that the chief executive should be elected by universal suffrage no later than 2003 . following this consensus , members of both councils will now proceed to scrutinize and discuss the details related to the selection of the chief executive , and where necessary to consult the organizations which they represent . before leaving this subject , i wish to mention the significance of the electoral law which will prescribe the specific election method in selecting the chief executive . we recommend that the electoral law should clearly enshrine the principle of one - person - one - vote and other principles essential in a truly democratic election . sir , so far i have reflected the major points related to the future political structure and on which we have reached broad agreement . mr. andrew wong who will speak immediately after me , and other honourable colleagues who will be speaking during this debate , will be touching on other equally important areas of the draft basic law , and no doubt will be expressing their individual views on various points . those members who have decided not to speak today have asked me to say that they support the agreement reached on the major issues . before concluding , i would like to emphasize the important role played by advisory boards and committees in the existing as well as future political structure of hong kong . as i recently said before the foreign affairs committee of the house of commons , the network of advisory boards and committees has been an important ingredient in the success story of hong kong , and an essential part of our consultative system of government . views put forward through the various boards and committees have contributed significantly to the decision making process , and all my honourable colleagues who have had experience either serving on or chairing these boards and committees will agree they provide useful sounding boards before policy decisions are made . hence it is of utmost importance that in addition to what we have recommended for the basic law , the future special administrative region government devises a means to continue tapping the specialist advice and expertise that comes from these boards and committees . but it is not my intention today to repeat what i said before the foreign affairs committee , for that represents only my personal views on possible practical working arrangements of the hong kong special administrative region government . conclusion to conclude , i commend to the community the recommendations agreed by my honourable colleagues on the political structure of the future hong kong special administrative region government . i hope they will be studied carefully by all . on our part , members of the executive and legislative councils will continue to study the draft basic law in detail and will strive to reach further consensus on other important areas not already covered . it is of utmost importance in the overall interest of hong kong that we can present a unified view to the basic law drafters . recent events in china and hong kong have brought home to us all that the assurance of the principle of " one country , two systems " is more necessary than ever . whilst the events have understandably led to confusion and anxiety for many , they have also brought the community together in an unprecedented way . never before has the community expressed their concern on an issue with such unity of purpose . i hope that when views by members of the community reach the basic law drafters , they will carry one voice : the voice of unity which we have now clearly heard in hong kong . as i said earlier , let us move forward together to ensure freedom , justice and democracy . sir , i beg to move . question on the motion proposed . mr. andrew wong : sir , i wholeheartedly support the motion of our senior member the honourable allen lee in calling upon the people of hong kong to express their views on " the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china ( draft ) " and urging the authorities concerned to take such views fully into account before the promulgation of the basic law . first of all , may i in my capacity as convener of the omelco standing panel on constitutional development pay tribute and express my thanks to members of the panel and all the honourable non-government members of the executive and legislative councils . before the publication of the second draft of the basic law , the panel held five meetings during the period from the end of the last year to early this year to discuss the issue of human rights and the proposal ( commonly known as cha - cha proposal ) put forth by the drafting committee for the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region . at that time , we had already considered the proposal too conservative . we maintained that the timetable as proposed for political development was too slow going . according to that timetable , we could only have universal suffrage in the elections of the legislative council and the chief executive by 2011 and 2012 ( 22 and 23 years later ) respectively . the proposal also suggested that before the introduction of universal suffrage , a referendum should be held with the approval of the legislative council , the chief executive and the standing committee of the national people 's congress , and the result of the referendum should only be valid and effective with the affirmative vote of more than 30% of the eligible voters , otherwise there would be a 10 - year interval before the next referendum was to be held . we found these proposed arrangements tantamount to hurdles in deterring political development . our preliminary conclusion then was that the proposal should be revised to provide a fixed timetable where the time taken to introduce universal suffrage in the elections of the entire legislative council and the chief executive would be advanced . as regards subsequent discussions in meetings of the panel and of the omelco in - house and our subsequent conclusions on the issue of the political structure , the honourable allen lee has just elaborated in some detail . members support that half of the seats of the legislative council should be returned by general election in 1997 , that all of the seats of the legislative council should be returned by general election in 2003 ( 14 years from now ) , and that the chief executive should be elected by general election not later than 2003 . here , i take this opportunity to call on the people of hong kong to remain open - minded and to seek consensual proposals so that we may , as i said last year in my speech in the debate on the basic law ( for solicitation of opinions ) draft , succeed in building and rebuilding hong kong as " rome was not built by one , but by many " . sir , allow me to further report on the work of the constitutional development panel and the omelco in - house meetings on the study of the basic law . since the publication of the second draft of the basic law in late february 1989 , the panel has held a total of 17 meetings during which all articles , preamble , annexes and appendices of the second draft of the basic law have been discussed and examined closely article by article and item by item . our work has not yet come to an end . furthermore , under the leadership of dame lydia dunn , senior member of the executive council , five omelco in - house meetings have been held to discuss the key issues of the political structure as contained in the second draft of the basic law . although significant consensual conclusions have been reached on issues concerning the legislative council , the chief executive and the relationship between the executive and the legislature , as elaborated earlier by the honourable allen lee , more work needs to be done . as a result , the omelco report on the second draft of the basic law cannot be ready today as scheduled , and may have to be delayed for about a month , which still meets the deadline of the end of july 1989 set by the basic law drafting committee for the consultation period . sir , allow me to take advantage of this public and solemn occasion to report to the people of hong kong the views of the constitutional development panel on six other major issues in the second draft of the basic law , other than those of the political structure . these issues are in no way less important or may even be regarded as more important than those of the political structure . first , the inter - relationship of the basic law , the sino - british joint declaration and the constitution of the people 's republic of china . the second draft only makes two direct references to the joint declaration , that is , paragraph 1 of the preamble which says " the chinese and british governments signed the joint declaration on the question of hong kong " and paragraph 2 which says " the basic policies of the people 's republic of china regarding hong kong have been elaborated by our government in the sino - british joint declaration " . it is uncertain whether the preamble will have any legal effect under the chinese legal system . the panel therefore doubts if this is sufficient to safeguard that the basic law will be in full accord with the joint declaration . furthermore , although paragraph 2 of the preamble states that the special administrative region will be established " in accordance with the provisions of article 31 of the constitution of the people 's republic of china " , and although article 11 of the second draft also states that the region will be established " in accordance with article 31 of the constitution of the people 's republic of china " , article 11 goes on to provide that " the systems and policies practised in the hong kong special administrative region , including ..., shall be based on the provisions of this ( basic ) law " and paragraph 3 of the preamble stipulates that the basic law is enacted " in accordance with the constitution of the people 's republic of china ( no specific reference to article 31 has been made ) ..., prescribing the systems to be practised in the hong kong special administrative region " . the panel is therefore wary of the possibility that certain elements of the chinese constitution may be introduced into the interpretation of and future amendments to the basic law , such as : in the preamble , the four cardinal principles ( 1 . leadership of the communist party of china , 2 . marxism - leninism and mao zedong thought , 3 . people 's democratic dictatorship , 4 . socialist road ) ; in article 1 , " a socialist ( state ) under the people 's democratic dictatorship " ; in article 3 , " apply the principle of democratic centralism " , and " the central and local state organs ... under the unified leadership of the central authorities " ; in article 5 , " upholds ... the socialist legal system " and " no laws or administrative or local rules and regulations shall contravene the constitution " ; and so on . the panel maintains that it is necessary to rewrite the preamble of the basic law , irrespective of whether or not it has legal effect , so as to establish in definite terms a corresponding relationship between the basic law and the joint declaration and confine the basic law 's relationship with chinese constitution to article 31 of the constitution only . the panel therefore proposes to amend paragraph 3 of the preamble possibly to read as follows : " in order to implement the basic policies of the people 's republic of china regarding hong kong as elaborated by our government in the sino - british joint declaration , to establish the hong kong special administrative region , and to prescribe the systems to be practised in the hong kong special administrative region , the national people 's congress hereby enacts the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china in accordance with article 31 and article 62 (13) ( which empowers that the national people 's congress to " decide on the establishment of special administrative regions and the systems to be instituted there " ) of the constitution of the people 's republic of china . " second , the definition of a high degree of autonomy . the conception of article 2 of the second draft is different from that of the joint declaration . it is stipulated in section 3 (2) of the joint declaration that : " the hong kong special administrative region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy , except in foreign and defence affairs which are the responsibilities of the central people 's government " . title i , paragraph 2 of annex i to the joint declaration states that : " the hong kong special administrative region ... shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy . except for foreign and defence affairs which are the responsibilities of the central people 's government , the hong kong special administrative region shall be vested with executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication " . the panel submits that it is imperative to define in the provisions of the basic law the " high degree of autonomy " . it is therefore proposed to amend article 2 to read possibly as follows : " the national people 's congress hereby vests the hong kong special administrative region with a high degree of autonomy except in foreign and defence affairs , and with executive , legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication , in accordance with the provisions of this law " . third , the interpretation of the basic law . section 1 of article 157 states that : " the power of interpretation of this law shall be vested in the standing committee of the national people 's congress " . the panel notes that according to article 67 (4) of the chinese constitution , " to interpret laws " is one of the powers and functions of the standing committee . section 2 of article 157 " authorize ( s ) the courts of the hong kong administrative region to interpret on their own , in adjudicating cases before them , the provisions of this law which are within the limits of the autonomy of the region . " section 3 gives permission to the effect that " the courts of the hong kong special administrative region may also interpret other provisions of this law ( the provisions on central affairs and provisions on central - regional relationship ) in adjudicating cases before them . " these are much welcomed by the panel . however , section 3 of article 157 also states that " if such interpretation ( of the aforesaid provisions ) will affect the judgements on the cases , " then " the courts of the region shall , before making their final judgements which are not appealable , seek an interpretation of the relevant provisions from the standing committee of the national people 's congress through the court of final appeal of the region . " the panel is most concerned about such an arrangement , all because the standing committee of the national people 's congress is a legislature . although the system of legislative interpretation which vests the power of interpretating the constitution and laws in the legislature is commonplace in socialist countries and territories , it is alien to hong kong and other capitalist countries and territories where the established practice is a system of judicial interpretation which vests the power of interpretation in the courts with the legislature having no part to play other than making amendments to legislation . this difference may threaten the promise that hong kong 's capitalist system and life - style shall remain unchanged for 50 years . the panel therefore considers that the power to interpret all provisions of the basic law should be delegated to the court of final appeal of the hong kong special administrative region which is to exercise such power in the place of or on behalf of the standing committee . the panel considers that article 157 should be rewritten possibly as follows : " in accordance with article 62 (13) and (15) of the constitution of the people 's republic of china , the national people 's congress hereby authorizes the courts of the hong kong special administrative region to interpret this law and the court of final appeal of the hong kong special administration region to render final interpretation " . if this formulation is adopted , the provision similar to a power of disallowance as stipulated in section 3 of article 17 , which provides for the standing committee to return any law enacted by the region which it considers to be not in conformity with the provisions of the basic law on central affairs or on central - regional relationship can be deleted while , at the same time , there will still be safeguards to ensure that the legislation of the region will not be in contravention of the provisions of the basic law . fourth , amendments to the basic law . article 158 specifies that " amendment proposals from the hong kong special administration region " should obtain " the consent of two - thirds of the deputies of the region to the national people 's congress , two - thirds of all the members of the legislative council of the region and the chief executive of the region " . in view of this role to be played by the deputies of the region to the national people 's congress in making amendment proposals , there exists the fear that they may become an organ of power . in this respect , it is understood that all the deputies to the national people 's congress from the provinces come from their respective provincial people 's congresses which are organs of power . the panel therefore considers that the power of proposing amendments to the basic law should be vested in the standing committee of the national people 's congress and the hong kong special administrative region . the standing committee should consult the committee for the basic law and obtain consent of two - thirds of all the members of the legislative council and the chief executive of the hong kong special administrative region before any amendment proposals to the basic law can be made . if the hong kong special administrative region wishes to propose any amendment to the basic law , the consent of two - thirds of all the legislative councillors and the chief executive will be required . such amendment proposal should then be submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress which shall consult the committee for the basic law on whether the proposal should be put to the national people 's congress on behalf of the hong kong special administrative region . in any case , this procedure should not involve the deputies of the hong kong special administrative region to the national people 's congress . fifth , the question of curfew and martial law . the panel welcomes the amendment to article 18 which specifies that national laws shall not be applied in the hong kong special administrative region except for those listed in annex iii to the basic law . but the panel has grave concern about section 4 of article 18 . according to section 4 of article 18 , the central people 's government ( the state council ) may decree the application of national laws in the hong kong special administrative region in either of the following circumstances : the standing committee of the national people 's congress decides to declare a state of war , or the standing committee of the national people 's congress , by reason of turmoil within the hong kong special administrative region which is " beyond the control of the region " , decides that the region is in a state of emergency , in other words , the imposition of curfew or martial law . the panel feels that separate arrangements should be made to deal with the two different situations : when a state of war is declared , and when there is turmoil within the hong kong special administrative region . for the former , it should be clearly stated which parts of the national laws are applicable to the hong kong special administrative region . as for the latter , the hong kong special administrative region should be able to make its own decision as to what kind of action or measure should be taken , which includes seeking assistance from the central people 's government . the panel doubts whether the application of national laws would be the best way to deal with internal turmoil . the panel therefore considers that the provision concerning turmoil in section 4 of article 18 should be deleted , and that the provision of section 3 of article 14 which states that " the government of the hong kong special administrative region may , in times of need , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief " should be sufficient to deal with turmoil within the region . sixth , the issue of human rights . the panel welcomes the amendment to article 39 by which the general limitation provision on human rights has now been removed . it is the opinion of the panel that in order to give effect to the provisions of the joint declaration that the two international covenants , the international covenant on civil and political rights and the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , " shall remain in force " , there appears to be a need for the people 's republic of china to become a signatory to the two covenants , lest the monitoring mechanism as currently provided in the two covenants will cease to apply to the hong kong special administrative region after 1997 . the panel also considers that a bill of rights should be promulgated in hong kong before 1997 . the panel further considers that the chinese and british governments ought to strive for an early understanding through the sino - british joint liaison group so that the people of hong kong can rest assured at the earliest possible time that the covenants " shall remain in force " . sir , i had originally wished to conclude my speech with the story of " kua fu " from the tang wen chapter of the book of lie zi . but i have already spoken for some time , and will have to leave it to a later date when the opportunity arises . here , i merely wish to say : " kua fu set out to chase the ( life engendering ) sun " , not because he overrated his strength , but because he was not mindful of the outcome and stood steadfast in his pursuit . although " in his quest , he died of thirst " , " his staff " ( possibly a willow branch ) which he dropped , " soaked in the remains of his body , grew into a forest called the deng forest . the deng forest spread until it covered several thousand miles " . ( how very true the chinese saying : the incidental planting of a willow branch results in a canopy of shade ! ) sir , i give you and the people of hong kong the quest of kua fu , and wholeheartedly support the motion of the honourable allen lee . mr. cheong : sir , the earthshaking strength created by the patriotic student movement that has been going on in china for over one month has reverberated through the mainland chinese people , the citizens of hong kong and macau as well as overseas chinese . such a feeling of flesh - and - blood ties has rarely been realized by hong kong people for many years . during this period , we have become emotionally insecure for we are concerned about the developments in both china and hong kong and also care very much about our future . such an emotional response is totally understandable . the impact of the movement on hong kong is not confined to emotional reactions . it has also aroused the hong kong people 's enthusiastic participation in a series of collective activities to express their discontent at the way the chinese government handles the event and to voice their views . nevertheless , we must be calm when considering whether the student movement and the way it is handled by the chinese government will bring about significant repercussions to hong kong 's future . sir , i must first of all stress that being calm is not the same as being cold - blooded , nor do i mean that the spirit to strive for democracy should be cooled down . what i want to say is that excessively emotional reactions should be followed by sensible analyses . we should try to sort out the basic responsibilities and directions of hong kong people in future in the light of the impetus given by these historic events . the driving force generated by emotions has already been released , it is time for us to look at the strength to be drawn from rational thinking . as we are disappointed at the way the chinese government handles the student movement , there are indications that hong kong people feel more worried about the future . their interest in the basic law has flagged . their confidence in the implementation of the basic law has been eroded . such a frame of mind is again understandable . nevertheless , we should give some thoughts to whether such a negative attitude will help solve the problem . no matter whether we choose to stay here after 1997 or we cannot leave due to objective factors , we after all love our home and should try our best to strive for an acceptable future for this place where we are rooted . it is undeniable that the future of hong kong hinges on the successful implementation of the sino - british joint declaration and the concept of " one country , two systems " . we should realize that the destinies of hong kong and china are interwoven ; but as china 's modernization programmes have just gone off the starting point , it will take a considerably long time before she can catch up with the level of development in hong kong . before that happens , hong kong people will definitely not like to see their progress being dragged down by a comparatively backward china after the handing - over of sovereignty . we shall be all the more unwilling and unhappy to see china having a chance to constantly and unduly intervene in the operation hong kong 's free economy and its high degree of autonomy . that is why the concept of " one country , two system " should be the most realistic and the best way out for hong kong . the basic law is the crucial document to ensure the realization of this concept . we all have a basic responsibility and right to express our views on this document . instead of trying to evade our responsibility in this regard , the 5 million - odd hong kong citizens should rather help formulate this important document which has direct bearings on future and our way of life . the people of hong kong must not remain silent any longer . may i appeal to them not to hold a pessimistic attitude towards the basic law . for the future of hong kong as well as for that of china , we should participate actively in helping to work out our future constitution . i appeal to the members of the community who know the basic law well to put forward its outline , explain it to the public in simple terms , and give them guidance on how to study and discuss it . this is the way to spread the importance of the rule of law throughout the community and to enable the constitution to serve its function as the guidance and common language of the ruler and the ruled . when the spirit of legality has its roots in the consciousness of the public , the abuse of law can be avoided . hong kong people can then bring into play the power of solidarity and co-operation . we can envisage that in the years to come , hong kong will have more difficulties and even more complicated problems to face . yet , hong kong still has to survive and move forward . we must persevere and , at the same time , maintain social stability and the power to expand our economy , so that we can preserve our strength to pull through . our objective is that we should always be ready to stand together . may i urge all hong kong people , regardless of sector affiliation , to recognize their work and the role they play in the community , hold fast to their posts , and spare no effort to create a better future for hong kong . in the past few years , due to the existence of too many divergent views , our strength has been divided . i hope that the recent events will awake the hong kong people , and that from now on we will pull our strength together on the the basis of mutual accommodation and mutual understanding to strive for the overall interests of the community and not to allow the enthusiastic efforts of the public to be wasted . although in this realistic society , many people may consider my aspirations to be too idealistic , i firmly believe that we should stand together and bring into full play our potentials to overcome all difficulties . this is the only direction towards which we should all move . i would like to take this opportunity to report to the council the position of the executive committee of the federation of hong kong industries on our future political structure . on hearing the honourable james tien and i explaining the omelco 's proposal at yesterday 's meeting , all members of the executive committee agreed to give support to the urge for unity and the consensus which the omelco has arrived at on hong kong 's political structure . sir , i would like to conclude my speech with the following encouraging words for your consideration : prosperity and stability , are what we seek ; let us put aside our differences and stand together , hold fast to our posts , give out our best , and move on together to create a better future for hong kong and china . with these remarks , i support the motion . 4.28 pm his excellency the president : members might like to take a break at this point . 4.55 pm his excellency the president : council will now resume . mr. cheung yan - lung : sir , while we are debating on the second draft of the basic law , i should like to call upon all of us to bear firmly in mind the response of the people of hong kong to the recent pro-democracy movement . the recent stunning massive public parades and rallies to echo the student movement in china will go down in the history of hong kong as monumental movements in its development of democracy . the calls for freedom and democracy have united the hearts of the people of hong kong who take to the streets and show their support . the enthusiastic and orderly participation of the public in the mass rallies and sit - ins have demonstrated the democratic spirit that enables tolerance and self-discipline to come into being in hong kong . in the face of these outpourings of democratic sentiments , we should be more cautious in our discussion of the basic law in order to ensure that the kind of freedom and democracy that the people want is enshrined and the aspirations of the people are put into effect . thus the basic law should be formulated on the basis of a spirit of democracy . it should be a document which will ensure the autonomy of the hong kong special administrative region and not an instrument with which the central government can tighten its control . look back on the drafting of the basic law , we note that during the previous round of consultation on the first draft of the basic law the general public undoubtedly showed their concern . however , people who actively took part in the consultation were confined to representatives from various sectors of the community , the people from opinion groups and other interested parties . for the purpose of maintaining the status quo of the hksar for another 50 years , an overall review on every facet of the hong kong society and the characteristics of different trades and professions was also conducted . the consultation exercise enabled the people of hong kong to take a fresh look at their society and the consultation report prepared by the consultative committee for the basic law also became valuable reference material for civic education because it had drawn the bottom lines of various social values which according to the views of the hong kong people should remain unchanged . in this connection , i wish to pay tribute to those who have worked hard during the consultation process . as regards the present round of consultation , i also wish to express my appreciation of the efforts of the secretariat of the consultative committee for the basic law in their production of the clearly written and highly readable reference papers . having studied the reference papers , i feel that some of the textual amendments to the draft basic law have been able to bring out the original meaning of the provisions . moreover , a number of amended articles in the draft basic law , especially those on which consultation reports have been prepared in the reference papers , show that the drafting committee has been responsive to the views collected . take for example , articles 17 , 19 , 45 , 47 and 157 have generally been amended in line with the wishes of the hong kong people . this is an improvement . apart from some controversial provisions on the subject of political structure , the entire draft basic law appears to be compact in its structure . semantically every word and expression has been well - thought , and in terms of spirit , it has managed to enshrine the concept of " one country , two systems " and high degree of autonomy . sir , if a consensus on the political structure can be reached at an earlier date , the task of formulating the constitution for hong kong will soon be completed . nevertheless , in the light of the recent pro-democracy movement in mainland china , i wish to make the following two points . firstly , paragraph 4 of article 18 of the basic law ( draft ) provides that in case the standing committee of the national people 's congress decides to declare a state of war or , by reason of turmoil within the hong kong special administrative region which is beyond the control of the region , decides that the region is in a state of emergency , the state council may decree the application of the relevant national laws in the region . i understand that such provision is necessary and proper . but the word " turmoil " is not clearly defined . the controversy as to whether the student movement in beijing is a " turmoil " or a " patriotic movement " has already triggered off a national crisis . today , mass parades , slogan - chanting demonstrations , sit - ins , hunger strikes and so on are very common acts of protest in hong kong . thus , the definition of " turmoil " is worthy of our attention . another point i would like to raise concerns article 21 which specifies that chinese citizens who are residents of the hong kong special administrative region shall be entitled to participate in state affairs in accordance with law . judging from the events arising from the student movements in china , we can see that the people of hong kong are willing , and have enough zeal and ability to participate in state affairs . the question is that the draft basic law has not elaborated on what kind of state affairs we are allowed to participate in . for example , are the student movements in beijing a kind of state affairs in which hong kong people are entitled to participate ? although the same provision also states that the people of hong kong shall locally elect deputies of the hong kong special administrative region to the national people 's congress to participate in the work of the highest organ of state power , events in the wake of the student movements have revealed that the national people 's congress and the standing committee of the national people 's congress themselves are not competent enough in handling this sort of state affairs . it is important that hong kong people can participate in the national people 's congress because in future the relationship between the hong kong special administrative region and the national people 's congress will definitely be very close . laws enacted by the hong kong special administrative region shall be reported to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for the record and the powers of the special administrative region are to be granted by the national people 's congress , the standing committee of the national people 's congress and the central people 's government . however , the hong kong special administrative region will be prone to unforeseeable difficulties in handling its affairs if the national people 's congress and the standing committee of the national people 's congress fail to perform their normal functions under the constitution of the people 's republic of china . on the contrary , if the national people 's congress and the standing committee of the national people 's congress can effectively provide checks and balances and play a monitoring role , the participation of hong kong people will truly have great significance . deputies of the hong kong special administrative region will then be in a very important position in persuading or influencing the central people 's government to take care of the overall interest of hong kong . therefore , i am of the opinion that hong kong should have the right to participate in the discussion on the number of seats and the election method of its deputies . apparently , this point is missed out in the draft basic law . sir , as regards the political structure proposed in the draft basic law , it has taken quite a long time for a consensus to be reached on the composition of the legislative council and the method for the selection of the chief executive . remarkable progress has been made in a series of omelco in - house meetings convened by dame lydia dunn . although members do not have an unanimous view on the method for the selection of the chief executive , consensus has been reached on the composition of the legislative council . the senior member of this council has given a full report on the details and i do not intend to repeat them here . i only want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the efforts made by every one in striving for a common goal -- democracy . the fact that they trust each other and sincerely try to seek a consensus is indeed encouraging . in summing up , i am glad that various sectors of the community are gradually working out a political structure which can be accepted by all . but on the other hand , what happened in china in recent days also clearly shows that the relationship between hong kong and mainland china has become increasingly close . the two places are closely linked in economic as well as social , cultural and political aspects . sir , i think this is a very natural development . and for this very reason , i have to emphasize that hong kong will become a special administrative region of china in 1997 and implement the " one country , two systems " concept as stipulated in the sino - british joint declaration . the idea of " one country " has been clearly explained and set out in the draft basic law . but is the protection for the implementation of " two systems " adequate ? for example , will future political changes in china affect the stability of our political structure and thus the economy and investment prospects of hong kong ? the very concept of " one country , two systems " is to make possible the mutual accommodation and non-interference of two different systems within one country . in future , this tiny place which adheres to capitalist practices in its economy , political structure and social system will have to co-exist with mainland china which practises the socialist system in a land area of several million square kilometres with a population of 1.1 billion . compared with the vastness of china , the future hong kong special administrative region is indeed insignificant . it is important that we should enshrine in the basic law the liberal spirit of the concept of " one country , two systems " and the guarantees made in the joint declaration . i would strongly urge people from all sectors of our community , particularly those who are expert in law and foreign constitution , to put forward more valuable suggestions on this matter so that a right balance is struck between " one country " and " two systems " . sir , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr. chan : sir , i believe we all anticipate that during the run - up to 1997 , some incidents which will deal a blow to the confidence of hong kong people will inevitably occur . the most striking event that has taken place so far is the recent student movement in beijing . it has shaken china as well as the hong kong community . at first , i was extremely worried about the future of china and hong kong . but after witnessing the two spontaneous protest marches of one million people which took place one after the other in hong kong , i began to set my mind at ease . i am confident that no matter how capricious the political situation in china may be , hong kong people will , at the critical moment , put aside their differences and voice their views in unity . all along , hong kong people do not have much trust in the basic law , and now even more people have lost faith in it . we are alarmed by the chinese leaders ' attitude towards their constitution , and no one can say for sure that our basic law will not be treated in the same way in future . however , i think that whether or not we have confidence in the basic law , we should ensure that it is drafted in the best possible way , so that we can have a good set of laws to base on in the future . for this reason , i have participated actively in the meetings of the omelco constitutional development panel . i might not be able to make any contribution , but i would like to have a deeper understanding of the basic law . in this regard , may i take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my good teacher , the honourable andrew wong , convener of the constitutional development panel . the panel has proposed a number of specific amendments to the draft basic law , particularly in the following major areas of concern : " the relationship between the central authorities and the hong kong special administrative region " , " the interpretation of the basic law " and " the link between the executive authorities and the legislature " . these improvements will help to provide a better safeguard for the future of hong kong . now i would like to talk about the omelco proposals just introduced by the honourable allen lee . it is most encouraging to learn that omelco members have reached a consensus on those areas of the basic law , and i fully support the proposals . all along i have been advocating direct elections and now the protest marches of a million citizens have repudiated the allegation that " hong kong people only care about money " . i have heard with my own ears the chanting of " long live democracy " which indicates that hong kong people are not lacking in political consciousness , they remain silent only because they will not make a fuss about nothing . finally , i am very happy to report to my honourable colleagues the results of my consultation with members of the eastern and wanchai district boards on the omelco proposal concerning the formation of the future legislative council . out of the 37 district board members ( about 80% of the total ) whom i had contacted , 28 members or 76% of the interviewees expressed support for the proposal ; eight expressed reservations or objection , of which six considered the pace of introducing direct elections to be too slow , one considered it too fast , and one opined that the design of that proposal was not comprehensive enough ; in addition , one other member refrained from expressing his / her views and would not discuss the matter until the student movement in beijing was over . sir , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr. chung : sir , the most important question before us now is whether the imposition of martial law and curfew by the chinese administration against the beijing student movement will lead to a new confidence crisis in hong kong and how we are going to minimize the resulting effect which may be detrimental to the future of hong kong after 1997 . i believe it is a matter of utmost concern for all the people in hong kong and the chinese government . for our part , faced with political earthquakes in china in the context of our future after 1997 , all we can do now is to take precautionary measures to strengthen the provisions regarding the safeguards for human rights and the high degree of autonomy laid down in the basic law . whether the basic law can withstand the test under a grim situation depends on whether the chinese government can spell out the principle of " one country , two systems " explicitly and specify the way of its implementation . therefore the map showing the extent of the hong kong special administrative region ( hksar ) with clear indication of its boundary of border defence should be added as an annex to article 1 under chapter i : general principles . the provisions under the chapter on relationship between the central authorities and the hong kong special administrative region should be the fundamental rules in giving effect to the principle of " one country , two systems " . the provision relating to the movement of the garrison under article 14 is a highly sensitive issue to the people of hong kong . hence the appropriate text of this article should be amended to read : " the government of the hong kong special administrative region may , in times of need , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in disaster relief ; and subject to a resolution endorsed by over half of the members of the legislature , ask the central people 's government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order . " in order words , the request for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order is subject to an endorsement of the legislative council . under article 18 , the laws listed in annex iii to the basic law ( the national laws ) shall be applied locally in the hksar by way of legislation , not just promulgation . moreover , unless endorsed by a majority in the legislature of the region , no inclusions of laws or legal documents other than those related to defence and foreign affairs listed in annex iii shall take effect . the article should also clearly stipulate that in case of turmoil within the hong hong special administrative region which is beyond the control of the region , and a state of emergency is declared , the central people 's government may decree the application of the relevant national laws in the region subject to the request made by the hksar with a majority endorsement in the legislature . furthermore , there is the need for a specific definition for turmoil . will a peaceful gathering or march by a million people be considered a turmoil ? under what circumstances will the state of emergency or related orders be declared , suspended and withdrawn ? regarding article 19 , in order to fulfil the central government 's promise that " there will be an independent judiciary and right of final adjudication without interference in the hksar " , section 3 of this article should be amended to read : article 23 in its present form provides that " the hong kong special administrative region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason , secession , sedition or theft of state secrets . " the legal terms in this article should be clearly defined . otherwise the following may happen : 1 among the permanent residents in hong kong , half of the ethnic chinese are holding foreign travel documents and / or they are working for foreigners . should certain circumstances come into being , some may have to live in fear of being charged with " treason " . 2 what is the meaning of " sedition " ? if its definition is not clear enough , our freedom of speech and press will be affected . 3 there is also some problem in the expression of " theft of state secrets " . in some countries , certain high technology and economic information are considered state secrets . anyone attempting to obtain them can be regarded as a special agent . however , in hong kong , these information and materials are regarded as commercial information which can be transacted legally in a free and competitive environment . therefore this expression in the article should be clearly defined , or else the normal development of the industries and commerce in hong kong will be hampered . in the chapter on the fundamental rights and duties of the residents , article 31 stipulates that hong kong residents shall have the freedom of movement and freedom of entry and exit . this is very important . however , this article should be amended to read : ...... hong kong residents shall have the freedom to travel and the freedom of entry and exit and the right to demand and be issued proper travel documents to facilitate entry and exit . unless restrained by law due to problems of their own , hong kong residents who hold valid travel documents shall be free to leave the region without special authorization . this is to prevent imposition of restrictions on applications for travel documents . sir , the draft basic law puts the articles concerning the executive authorities , the legislature and the judicial organs under the chapter on political structure , indicating that the fundamental political structure of the hksar will be executive - led . but under the principle of a high degree of autonomy by the hong kong people , omelco members have recently reached a preliminary concensus on the election method of the chief executive , his terms of reference , the possibility of deviation from popular will and the need for a more reasonable and fair check and balance to be exercised by the legislature on the future executive authorities . i support the views expressed by the senior member , honourable allen lee , on the part concerning the political structure in the basic law . although omelco members have reached a preliminary concensus on the political structure of the hksar and the method of election of the chief executive and legislature , i believe we still have to consult various professional bodies and the public for their opinions on the basic law . now , i want to be more specific with article 72 . in my opinion , the power of the legislative council under this provision should be expanded to include the following : if there are any important issues concerning public interest , the legislative council should have the right to appoint special committees if necessary to conduct independent investigations and hearings and then to submit their findings to the legislative council for necessary action . the purpose of delegating such power to the legislative council is to substantively reinforce public participation in the monitoring of the government machinery and public affairs in order to achieve more effective control . concerning the power of amendment of the basic law , article 158 stipulates that such power shall be vested in the national people 's congress ( npc ) . no amendment to the basic law , however , shall contravene the established basic policies of china regarding hong kong , that is , the provisions of the sino - british joint declaration . however , some may worry that the basic law may be amended at any time in the future . in my opinion , in the composition of the committee for the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region , hong kong members should be in the majority . furthermore , article 158 should stipulate that the legislative council of hksar shall have full power to make amendment proposals to the basic law . any proposals concerning hong kong , including those put forth by the legislative councillors or hong kong deputies to npc , shall first be endorsed by the legislative council . all proposals so endorsed should be subject to the consent of the chief executive before they are submitted to the npc by the hong kong deputies to npc . the rationale behind such addition is by unifying the special administrative region 's power to propose amendments to the basic law , it will be able to avoid the formation of two power centres , namely , the " legislative councillors " and the " hong kong deputies to npc " . it will also be in line with the needs of the central and local governments to set up a reasonable legislative system . we all know that the basic law has not yet been finalized and the second round of consultation on the draft is still under way in hong kong . however , before the student movement in beijing and incidents at the tiananmen square are settled , we learn that individual members of the basic law drafting committee ( bldc ) and basic law consultative committee ( blcc ) have tendered their resignation . it is most regrettable and their resignation has caused much public concern . in my opinion , if it is felt that the chinese communist party and the high - ranking chinese officials have mishandled the student movement in beijing and ignored the demand for democracy , it would only highlight more evidently the importance to fight for democracy and the rule of law for our future generations on the part of members of the bldc and blcc . this is an undeniable duty of the times . i hope the public will offer more encouragement and opinions . sir , with the above proposed amendments to the basic law , together with the opinions from the public and various sectors as well as the endeavours of the bldc and blcc , i believe the content of the basic law will even be more reasonable and realistic . no matter what reshuffle there will be in beijing , on the basis of the provisions of the joint declaration and the principle of " one country , two systems " , the basic law will be able to maintain our confidence on hong kong 's future beyond 1997 . with these remarks , sir , i support the motion . mr. ho sai - chu : sir , the present round of consultation on the second draft of the basic law , which began in late february this year to solicit the views of hong kong people for a second time , is a crucial process in the formulation of the basic law . during this period when extensive consultation on the draft of the basic law is in progress , large - scale student movements surged in beijing and other major cities of china . the news of these movements has produced enormous impact on the people of hong kong . apart from triggering off mass parades in support of the students in china , it has also affected the consultation on the draft basic law . i have no intention to comment on the situation in china . i simply want to talk about the attitude that should be taken towards the present consultation . first , i must reiterate that in accordance with the provision of the sino - british joint declaration , the sovereignty of hong kong will be handed back to china on 1 july 1997 and the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region will be the constitution which governs hong kong . this is a policy stipulated by both the chinese and british governments in the joint declaration and so far there is no sign of any change . some may worry that even if the basic law is in its best formulation it will only be a nominal piece of constitutional document if there is no democracy and the rule of law is not strictly enforced in the mainland . while it is understandable that the situation in the mainland has undermined the confidence of some people , the enactment of the basic law remains a task to which we should spare no efforts . for each of us who is prepared to make hong kong our permanent home and is concerned about hong kong 's future , this task should be considered as the mission of our times . i have mentioned in different forums that the enactment of the basic law mainly hinges upon the concept of " one country , two systems " . mainland china is practising the socialist system but hong kong will maintain its capitalist system . the distinction between the two systems is absolutely clear and there will not be any intermeddling . geographically speaking , hong kong is insignificant compared with the large expanse of the chinese territory . given this sharp contrast in size , it is the hope of the hong kong people that china will not interfere in hong kong 's affairs . the " four insistencies " are the principles that china is upholding in its decision - making and administration ; whereas in hong kong , the existing system and lifestyle will remain and the people of hong kong will be allowed to make their own decision on future changes , if any . the people of hong kong should be satisfied with such a scenario . so far the chinese leadership have not broken any promises given to the people of hong kong nor have they interfered with the internal affairs of hong kong . as all the major principles and policies remain intact , there is no convincing justification to assume that the basic law will only be a nominal piece of document . obviously , it is unrealistic to expect that mainland china will change and bring in freedom and democracy of western capitalist provenance . after all , such a change will not be in line with the " one country , two systems " concept . to exert ourselves to take up such an impractical cause will only be disadvantageous to the interest of hong kong . i therefore urge that the political situation in china should be viewed separately from that in hong kong and that the confidence and the actual task before us should be treated as separate issues . in this connection , the drafting of the basic law is our fundamental job . that some people have lost their confidence is purely a personal matter and they are free to make their own choice . however , the basic law concerns the long - term interest of hong kong as a whole and the well - being as well of our future generations . for the future of hong kong , a positive approach in striving for a good basic law is better than a negative approach of giving up . i hope that all of us will make concerted efforts to see it through and continue to fulfil our responsibility by enthusiastically putting forward our views , so that the drafting process of basic law will be completed satisfactorily . sir , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr. hui : sir , when many people were worrying that the basic law ( draft ) would meet with the coolest ever response from hong kong residents during the second round of consultation , the most magnificent democratic liberal movement in the history of china staged by hundreds of thousands of university students in beijing erupted in tiananmen square . under the influences of that movement , the people of hong kong , who are far away from beijing , also witnessed two exciting and touching historic mass parades in each of which about one million people participated . i think that it is mainly due to the following two reasons that activities organized here in hong kong in support of the beijing student movement can easily attract hundreds of thousands of people who feel obliged to put aside their normal daily work to participate in such activities : firstly , as hong kong people have long been enjoying liberty and freedom , they can hardly imagine the extent of freedom that the residents will be allowed to enjoy after 1997 under the rule of the chinese communist party . when the silent majority see how a handful of autocratic chinese leaders use various means to suppress the call for democracy and freedom from millions of people , they can no longer be silent . apart from expressing loudly with one righteous voice their sympathy for the students , they also clearly realize that what happens in china today is a reflection of what will occur to hong kong in future . if they do not show their support and fight for their demands now , when will they have a better chance ? secondly , since the monarchial system was established in china , the nation has never been put under democratic rule . thus when the largest democratic movement broke out in china , chinese people all over the world , driven by nationalism and a sense of mission , stand up together and show their support . they all hope that their compatriots in china can lead a better life at an early date . so the fight for democracy is not only a global trend , but also a commitment of hong kong people to the interests of the chinese race . as hong kong and china have already become mutually dependent , hong kong will surely become one of the chinese communities receiving the widest attention in the world because of its future democratic development . from the discipline of the parading processions and the spontaneity with which people from various sectors make banners and placards as well as coin slogans , it can be seen that most people possess very high political wisdom . they can not only distinguish between good and evil , but also have a great affection for their nation . in the past , hong kong people seemed to be politically apathetic just because they could not find out the most convenient channel to express their feelings , or the political nature of those events was not important enough as to be able to drive the masses into taking action to express their views . traditionally , chinese people are inclined to be politically passive and reserved . from now on certain people can no longer try to suppress the natural democratic development of the local political system on the pretext of " hong kong people are apathetic towards politics " , " direct elections will lead to unrest " and so forth , for local residents actually treasure very much their hard - earned prosperity and stability , democracy and freedom . in fact , as i have previously pointed out , hong kong should speed up the democratization of its political structure , not as a means to offer resistance to communism , but to keep in line with its own economic development . in capitalist countries , politics are always used to serve the economy , for only by so doing can society make steady progress . in china the situation is just reversed , and the chinese government has just learnt an unforgettable lesson in this respect . it is on this basis that the vast majority of my colleagues in the social services sector and i will hold even more steadfastly to our democratic views in regard to the provisions on the political structure in the basic law ( draft ) which have yet to be finalized . our demands are clearly reflected by the three questionnaire opinion surveys which i conducted respectively in 1987 with regard to the green paper on representative government , in 1988 with regard to the draft basic law ( for solicitation of opinions ) and in 1989 with regard to the basic law ( draft ) . the conclusions of the three surveys are rather consistent too . first of all , regarding the composition of the legislative council of the future hong kong special administrative region ( hksar ) , out of a total of 151 valid returns received in the current survey , 71% maintained that half of the members of the first legislative council should be returned by direct elections . this coincides with the unanimous view of the omelco members . however , views are still slightly divided over the timing of the introduction of a fully directly elected legislature . while the omelco members have reached a consensus that a fully elected legislature should not be introduced until 2003 , that is , the third legislative council , the findings of my survey indicated that 63% of the interviewees supported the idea of holding a referendum within the first term of the legislative council to decide whether all members of the legislature shall be selected by general election in the following term . although we have now ruled out the option of holding a referendum to decide the matter , the majority of my colleagues in the social work sector and i are inclined to support the early introduction of a fully directly elected legislature , the sooner the better . as for the selection of the chief executive , it is more difficult to reach a consensus . my survey revealed that 56% of the respondents considered it appropriate to introduce general election from the very beginning for the selection of the first chief executive , whereas 36% opined that general election should start with the second chief executive . in other words , over 90% of the interviewees are of the view that the selection of the chief executive by general election should be introduced no later than 2002 , that is , for the selection of the second chief executive . in the light of the above findings , i think the proposal broadly agreed by the omelco members that the chief executive shall be elected by general election from 2003 can be reluctantly accepted . while we are moving towards a consensus regarding the composition of the legislative council and the selection of the chief executive , we should not overlook the importance of the relationship between the future executive authorities and the legislature . if a proper link between these two bodies has not been established , no matter how many directly elected seats are made available in the legislature , there is still no way to realize the principle that the executive authorities should be accountable to the legislature . i think the adoption of a ministerial system similar to that established in western democratic countries would be a more prudent approach and would be compatible with our present consultation structure . finally , regarding social welfare , 85% of the interviewees considered it necessary to amend the first sentence of article 36 of the draft basic law to read : " hong kong residents shall have the right to social welfare and retirement security " so as to further safeguard the right to retirement benefits . moreover , 82% of the respondents proposed to amend article 4 by adding the following sentence : " the government of the hksar shall , within the scope of this law , take measures to promote the general well - being of the residents of the hksar and ensure that they can maintain a basic standard of living . " being the mini-constitution of the future hksar , the basic law should fully reflect the wishes of hong kong people . the active participation of the local residents in various political activities recently not only demonstrates their potential political wisdom , but also reveals their strong desire for democracy and freedom . the chinese leaders and members of the basic law drafting committee should heed these facts and amend the basic law ( draft ) in accordance with the general wishes of the hong kong people , so that this mini-constitution can truly realize the concept of " one country , two systems " and help maintain a society which will enjoy a high degree of democracy and freedom . may i reiterate that the basic law will need the trust and support of the general public before it can serve a positive purpose . of course , if a complete change can be made to the present situation in china where the party dominates the government and the government dominates the law , it will be so much the better . sir , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr. martin lee : sir , the movement for democracy in china has received very active support from hong kong ; but the imposition of martial law and the news ban in beijing have brought about great concern and worry to our people . as we look towards 1997 , it is perfectly plain that the best scenario is for china herself to have an open and democratic system of government so that human rights and press freedom can be protected . for in that event , the people of hong kong need not fear that their much cherished freedoms would be infringed , for example , by the imposition of martial law . but if that cannot materialize , and the present indications are that it will take a long time before china will have democracy , then we must make sure that the basic law will be effective in separating the hong kong special administrative region from mainland china under the policy of " one country , two systems . " and that is why we should devote our greatest attention to the drafting of the basic law . of course , there are cynics who say that no matter how good the basic law is , china may not follow it . as to that , we must wait and see . but if the basic law is not even a good constitutional document , then people will not even wait to see . i therefore submit that even if we take the cynical approach , we must still do our best to improve on the present draft basic law and hope that its terms will be honoured by china after 1997 . sir , article 35 of the constitution of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) provides : " citizens of the people 's republic of china enjoy freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration . " but we have seen how these constitutional rights were swept away when the leadership of the chinese communist party declared the peaceful and orderly demonstrations to be " turmoil " and imposed martial law . it is therefore our duty as members of the legislative council and leaders of the community to ensure that the basic law will give to our people a system of government which will , as far as possible , prevent similar occurrences from happening after 1997 . it is significant to note what the paramount leader of china , mr. deng xiaoping , had to say in a recent speech : " the students are using the rights of democracy and freedom in the constitution to impose limitations on us . " but members should not be surprised with such a statement , for it is in accordance with one of the four basic principles of the constitution : " " , of the prc , which upholds the leadership of the chinese communist party . so how can it be right for the students to use democracy or freedom to impose limitations on the party ? but the people of hong kong are understandably worried that if the communist party leaders can do this to their very own students , in the heart of their own capital , what is there to stop them from doing it to us after 1997 ? and how can the recent massive demonstrations in the past two sundays be tolerated , even though they were conducted in a perfectly orderly manner ? i therefore suggest that the constitution of the prc be amended by stating clearly that the four basic principles and in particular that of the leadership of the chinese communist party will not apply to the hong kong special administrative region ( hksar ) . moreover , it is abundantly clear that we need a new chapter in the basic law to deal with the imposition of martial law and the declaration of a state of emergency in the hksar . there may be three possibilities for emergencies to arise : first , if the hksar is in a state of emergency because the prc is at war with another country , then according to paragraphs 18 and 20 of article 67 of the constitution of the prc , the standing committee of the national people 's congress ( npc ) may proclaim a state of war or decide to enforce martial law throughout the whole country . in such eventuality , the garrison stationed in the region may be ordered to defend the region and help to maintain law and order in it . there will be some restrictions on the powers of the hksar government , but this is acceptable because the hksar government is unable to cope with such emergency situations on its own . and under article 18 of the draft basic law , the central people 's government may , by decree , apply certain nationwide laws to the region . however , such nationwide laws must not be allowed to override the basic human rights expressly entrenched in the international covenant on civil and political rights , even in these emergencies , such as the right to life , and the right against torture . secondly , there may be a state of emergency in the region ( due either to turmoil in the areas outside the region , spilling into it , or disturbances within the region itself ) . but the hksar government is able to contain it . in this situation , article 14 of the draft basic law stipulates that the military forces to be stationed in the hksar shall play no part in the maintenance of public order of the region , unless its assistance is requested by the hksar government . thirdly , the state of emergency may deteriorate to such an extent that it is beyond the control of the hksar government . paragraph 20 of article 67 of the constitution of the prc provides that the standing committee of the npc may decide to enforce martial law in particular provinces , autonomous regions or municipalities directly under the central government ; and paragraph 16 of article 89 empowers the state council to decide on the enforcement of martial law in parts of provinces , autonomous regions or municipalities directly under the central government . but neither article makes any reference to " special administrative regions " . accordingly , neither the standing committee of the npc , nor the state council , is empowered under the constitution of the prc , to impose martial law in the hksar , or send in the troops . and since all internal disturbances of the region shall first be dealt with by the hksar government , the hksar government would be in the best position to determine whether a particular disturbance has gone beyond its control . the basic law should therefore stipulate that when the chief executive of the region determines that the turmoil in the region has become uncontrollable , he may , under article 14 of the basic law , invite the garrison to assist in restoring law and order to the region . the invitation must be endorsed by the legislative council within three days . and if the legislative council were to refuse to endorse the invitation , or decided that the hksar could handle the situation by itself , then it should be given power to order the troops to return to their barracks . we should insist that even when the hksar is in a state of emergency , the right to administer the region should still be vested in the hksar government . and the garrison 's duty is to restore law and order to the region when requested to do so , and not to administer the region , even under martial law . this is essential to the region 's high degree of autonomy . in dealing with emergency situations , several basic principles must be followed : ( a ) the chief executive should be solely responsible for declaring a state of emergency , as he can respond faster . but as the legislative council will not be given any opportunity to debate it beforehand , the period of emergency must be short . i would suggest three days . ( b ) the decision of whether to prolong the period of emergency should be vested in the legislative council , so as to provide the necessary check on the emergency powers of the chief executive . ( c ) even in times of emergency , some basic human rights must not be infringed , such as the right to life and the right against torture . ( d ) even in times of emergency , the administration of the hksar should still be left with the hksar government . and the garrison must confine its role to restoring law and order , and not to interfere in the local affairs of the region as provided in article 14 of the draft basic law . sir , i now turn to the political structure of the hksar . a lot of re-thinking has taken place both inside and outside this chamber because of recent events in china and in hong kong . the people of hong kong are now more convinced than ever before that the future chief executive and legislature must not be under the influence or control of the central authorities or the chinese communist party . and many members of omelco are willing to support a more democratic political structure , as mentioned by the honourable mr. allen lee . indeed , members of omelco realize that our people are ready for democracy and that the myth that hong kong people are apathetic towards politics and are only interested in making money is finally exploded . however , many of my honourable colleagues still hold the view that the first chief executive should not be elected by universal adult suffrage . when this issue was debated at our in - house meetings behind closed doors , i listened with care , but i did not hear a single convincing argument in support of that view . of course , the issue of sovereignty was put forth as an argument against having the first chief executive elected on universal adult suffrage . but with the " lo wu solution " to the legislative council , i cannot see how this argument can stand . for just as members of this council who retire from office on 30 june 1997 are eligible to serve on the first legislature of the hksar , so long as they support the basic law , are willing to loyally serve the hksar , and meet the requirements set forth in the basic law , so the first chief executive can be elected before the l july 1997 , and be appointed on that date , provided he fulfils the same three requirements . the second argument put forth was that such a major election during the transition period would disturb the smooth transfer of sovereignty . but if the chief executive were elected in the latter part of 1996 or the early part of 1997 , on the understanding that he would assume office on l july 1997 , it would engender more confidence in the people , and lead to a more smooth handover of government . besides , which is a more difficult election to run : to elect one person as chief executive , or to elect 400 or 800 members of the electoral college called the election committee ? the third argument was that china might not agree that the first chief executive be elected by universal adult suffrage . this argument appears to have found favour with many of my honourable colleagues . but i regret to say that it is a thoroughly bad argument . now it is accepted that in order to sell their proposal to the people of hong kong , that is before the year 2003 , a chief executive would only be elected by an electoral college , the basic law must ensure that the members of the electoral college would be democratically elected , so that beijing would have no control or influence over his election . on that premise , let us look at china 's position . if china does not want to control the election of the chief executive , she will not object either to having the first chief executive elected by universal adult suffrage , or by an electoral college as per omelco 's majority model . but the people of hong kong will clearly prefer the former because they need not wait for the enactment of electoral laws to assure them that members of the electoral college will really be democratically elected . on the other hand , if china does want to control the election of the first chief executive , then beijing will reject both models . on that ground alone , members should support having the first chief executive elected by universal adult suffrage . sir , i appeal to honourable members that we must think only for the people of hong kong who have recently demonstrated quite conclusively that they care for their future and that they are ready for democracy . and we must stop trying to second guess china for the simple reason that we do not know whether beijing has a bottom - line , and if so , what it is , and whether this bottom - line , if any , can be changed . indeed , we owe it to our people to ensure that the model finally contained in the basic law will be acceptable to them . sir , thousands of university students have held a hunger strike -- a long hunger strike -- in beijing , wanting democracy . and if we also want democracy in hong kong , can we really face them when we do not adopt a truly democratic model in the basic law ? sir , it is quite clear from recent events , that nobody in hong kong wants to have a chief executive who takes orders no matter how unreasonable , from the leadership of the chinese communist party . and nobody wants to see their constitutional rights of freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession , and of demonstration , to be taken away at the whim of the party leaders . i therefore believe that the people of hong kong will not accept the omelco majority model , that the chief executive will not be directly elected until the year 2003 , because the first chief executive is the most important of all chief executives , for he may entrench laws and systems during his term of office thus rendering all subsequent governments undemocratic . sir , although omelco is unable to reach complete consensus at this point of time , i do not think it matters greatly because i hope the consultation period on the draft basic law will be prolonged in the light of recent events . further , the basic law consultative committee should immediately resume its duty in canvassing the views of the public because the whole of hong kong will be looking at the draft basic law in a completely new light . sir , apart from the political structure of the hksar , i have always stressed the importance of the relationship between the executive authorities and the legislature . and i am glad that omelco has reached consensus on greater accountability on the part of the executive authorities and the necessity of giving more power to the legislature so as to enable it to provide the necessary checks and balances on the executive authorities . as to the relationship between the central authorities and the hksar , i fully endorse the position reached by omelco . i wish only to add here that counter - revolutionary offences in china must not be introduced to the hksar whether as a nationwide law under article 18 , or by any other means whatsoever . sir , may i end by quoting from my own speech delivered to this council on 5 november 1986 , on direct election : " ... many people are more convinced now , more than ever before , that direct election is our only hope . and before long , it will grow into the most powerful chorus people have ever heard ; and people all over the world will hear it reverberating across our valleys , over our hills and beyond our seas . for this is the true voice of our people . for this is the voice of hong kong . " mr. szeto : sir , the patriotic movement for democracy started by the students of beijing has shaken heaven and earth and moved gods and spirits to tears . as blood is thicker than water , this movement has wakened all chinese throughout the world . they have united into a large and mighty army of support . the hong kong citizens of whom more than 98% are chinese marched in the forefront of this army . in the past month or so , hundreds of thousands and even a million hong kong people have time and again joined peaceful actions in a highly emotional yet soberly restrained manner . their nationalistic passion , democratic aspiration and admirable sense of rationality that were long debased have been given abundant expression . who can still say that they are the politically apathetic silent majority or a population who blindly seek for the benefit of " free lunch " ? although there are people who refuse to accept the idea of holding a referendum on the draft basic law , recently , the people of hong kong have , as a matter of fact , taken part vigorously in a number of referenda . the ballot results are crystal clear . an overwhelmingly absolute majority demands that the pace of democratic development should be quickened and that the basic law must provide for a democratic system of government to safeguard the prosperity , stability , freedom , human rights and the rule of law after the year 1997 and to turn the empty promise of " one country , two systems " into a workable formula more likely to come to pass . the harsh facts of reality have taught us a lesson that we cannot rely on sincerity alone , that absolute power will , in its inevitable course of development , breed absolute corruption , that prosperity , stability , freedom , human rights and the rule of law can be truly protected only by means of a democratic system of government , and that the fulfilment of the " one country , two systems " policy is not an imperial gift but something which all the people in hong kong must make concerted efforts to fight for . the people of hong kong who have been awakened and united by the patriotic movement of the beijing students for democracy must continue to stay awake , strengthen their bond of solidarity and seize every opportunity to press their demand for a democratic basic law . i am willing to work to the best of my ability for this cause and even lay down my life for this mission . this is a time of darkness . this is a time of light . this is a time when darkness and light are engaged in a decisive battle . let all of us in hong kong mobilize in unity to shape our own destiny and strive for democracy , freedom , human rights , the rule of law , prosperity , stability and a better tomorrow . sir , with these remarks , i support the motion . mr. tam ( in cantonese ) : sir , after the publication in of the first draft of the basic law for solicitation of opinions last year , the legislative council held a motion debate to discuss the issue . regrettably i did not take part in the debate due to my absence from hong kong . now this council holds a motion debate on the draft basic law again . however on this occasion , the debate coincides with the occurrence of the massive patriotic pro-democracy movement mounted by beijing students . a majority of the hong kong people actively give support to the beijing student movement and show concern for the development in china . what is the meaning of holding discussions on the basic law at this historic moment ? what sort of outlook will be held by hong kong people ? some people are of the opinion that the hardline measures taken by the chinese government against students seriously dampen hong kong people 's confidence in the chinese government and hong kong 's future ; they worry that the basic law will be no more than a meaningless piece of paper after 1997 . they refer to the increasing number of people emigrating from hong kong and the volatile situation of the stock market as evidences of the confidence crisis in hong kong . on the other hand , some people consider that the basic law is of vital importance because it is a legal document that gives effect to the principle of " one country , two system with high degree of autonomy " and stipulates the future relationship between china and hong kong . accordingly they think that it is the time to strive for the formulation of the basic law in such a manner that will allow for the implementation of high degree of autonomy to the fullest extent in the future hong kong special administrative region . the foregoing two schools of thinking represent the existing attitudes of many hong kong people towards the basic law . undeniably these thinkings are generally justified . if we consider the matter in a longer term and on the basis of the direction towards which we are heading , i am still optimistic of hong kong 's future development . so long as the basic law can adequately fulfil the common demands of the hong kong people , i believe the basic law can still win the recognition and support of the hong kong community . hereunder i wish to touch on several aspects of the existing draft basic law that are worthy of note in the hope that my comments will provide some food for thought in our discussion . political structure so far as the consultation of the draft basic law is concerned , the discussion on our future political structure has all along been a matter of major concern , in particular the selection of the chief executive and the formation of the legislature being the foci of attention . although different sectors of the community basically agree to democratic advances in the development of our political structure , there are diverse views on the pace and the speed of constitutional development . at the time of intensive exchange of views in the dialogue between the parties concerned to strive for a consensus on constitutional development at this final and crucial stage in the drafting of the basic law , great changes have taken place in our society . 6.00 pm his excellency the president : mr. tam , i am sorry i must interrupt you because it is now six o'clock and under standing order 8 (2) , the council should now adjourn . chief secretary : sir , with your consent , i move that standing order 8 (2) be suspended so as to allow the council 's business this afternoon to be concluded . question proposed , put and agreed to . his excellency the president : mr. tam , please continue . tam yiu chung : in the past many people took the view that the civic awareness and desire for participation of the hong kong people were not strong enough , and thus argued that it was undesirable to introduce a democratic political structure too rapidly . it was also said that only by way of educating the public step by step that we can enhance their political awareness and concern and that we can have the prerequisite for setting up a democratic political structure . therefore , the need to develop our political structure on the principle of orderly progression was advocated and it was thought that a democratic political structure with universal suffrage for the election of its chief executive and with all members of its legislative being directly elected can only come about gradually . however , tens of thousands of hong kong people have shown their concern in the recent political situation in china . their enthusiasm for democracy and freedom shown in the spontaneous massive movement has prompted us to take note of a population that is capable of active participation . it is no longer appropriate for us to say that the hong kong people are politically apathetic , devoid of the desire for participation or indifferent to social , political and national issues . in fact , in the wake of the recent events in hong kong , many people now think that we should step up the pace for democratization and openness in hong kong 's future political structure . the people of hong kong and local bodies now tend to move towards a more united front to reach for a consensus . if the people of hong kong can be united on the basis of a common view , i believe the basic law drafting committee ( bldc ) will entertain our proposal and make amendments accordingly . a stage of emergency in addition to the important issue of the development of a democratic political structure , the people of hong kong also cherish dearly the personal freedom we now enjoy and hope that the freedom of the residents of the future hksar can be adequately safeguarded under the basic law . the student movement in china and the imposition of martial law in beijing have drawn people 's attention to the provisions of the basic law concerning the declaration of a state of emergency . i think that the relevant articles of the basic law should be reviewed and that we should carefully consider and examine any problems that may arise from a state of emergency . the only article of the basic law that refers to a state of emergency is article 18 which , inter alia , states : " in case the standing committee of the national people 's congress decides to declare a state of war or , by reason of turmoil within the hong kong special administrative region which is beyond the control of the region , decides that the region is in a state of emergency , the state council may decree the application of the relevant national laws in the region . " although this article mainly provides for the condition of applying national laws in hong kong , hong kong citizen 's freedom will certainly be restrained once a state of emergency is declared . i think the following points are worthy of note : (1) the above - mentioned article does not provide for the conditions of declaring a state of emergency . conditions such as the outbreak of war , internal turmoil and serious natural disasters may be regarded as the circumstantial factors for the declaration of a state of emergency . i feel that relevant conditions ought to be spelt out in the basic law . (2) it appears that the standing committee of the national people 's congress is the sole authority to make decision on the declaration of a state of emergency . what role will the government of the hksar play and what position will it be placed when such circumstances arise ? in the event that the standing committee of the national people 's congress decides that the country is in a state of war or martial law be imposed , invariably a state of emergency would also be declared in hong kong because hong kong is part of china . however , how can it be decided that a turmoil is beyond the control of the hksar ? should the decision be made by npc or hksar ? (3) even if hong kong has a part to play in deciding and declaring the region to be in a state of emergency , there are no provisions governing the procedures of the declaration of a state of emergency and the monitoring measures . normally it is the executive authority which exercises the power of declaring a state of emergency , hence it is essential that the exercise of such power by the executive authority should be examined and monitored by the legislature . relevant provisions on such procedures should be clearly spelt out in the basic law . (4) to safeguard the fundamental rights and freedom of hong kong residents , is it necessary to stipulate any rights and freedom which cannot be deprived of even when the region is declared to be in a state of emergency ? the international covenant on civil and political rights that shall remain in force after 1997 has stipulated that certain freedom and rights should not be denied . as such , is it necessary to put down in black and white unequivocally the relevant provisions governing these safeguards . (5) in what form should the provisions of the state of emergency be formulated in the basic law ? should these be specifically stated in a separate chapter or article , or would it suffice to lay down the provisions just in simple terms ? how can we strike a balance and formulate provisions that are adequately clear and yet without going into great length unnecessarily ? in any case , provisions on the state of emergency in the basic law are definitely essential . of course , the general public in hong kong cherish very much the freedom they now enjoy and wish that hong kong would never be declared to be in a state of emergency by reason of turmoil . but as a common saying goes , " always be prepared for the worst " ; thus it is of absolute necessity that the existing provisions in the draft basic law regarding the state of emergency be reviewed to introduce reasonable amendments . i shall raise questions on this issue in the coming bldc meeting for discussion . provision on labour matters the hong kong government has all along advocated a policy of non-intervention in our economy and it is stressed that market force should come into play in solving our economic and social problems . although the labour sector persistently strives for revamping our labour laws in a bid to provide our labour force with better fundamental protection , it is regretted that the proposals which are supported by the labour sector have not been seriously and thoroughly implemented or introduced by the administration . judging from the government 's objection to the setting up of a central provident fund and the absence of a comprehensive labour policy , we realize that the government has not provided the workers with any protection so far , nor has due recognition and respect been given to the representativeness of the trade unions . being a representative of the labour sector in the legislative council , i have received numerous representations from a great number of trade unions and labour organizations seeking to improve workers ' welfare and the status of trade unions as soon as possible . in these representations there are widespread requests for the inclusion in the basic law of the provisions governing the protection of pension benefits for workers and the right of collective bargaining . for the betterment of the livelihood and status of the workers , i therefore support the proposal for the right of collective bargaining to be added to article 27 , and amendments to be added to article 36 to the effect that there will be legal protection for pension benefits . being the blueprint for the future of our society , the basic law is meant for promoting the general welfare of the residents of hksar . hence there is a need for working out a social system that will reasonably balance the interests of all sectors of the community , provide the masses of workers in hong kong with the right of holding dialogue on equal terms and give them reasonable welfare and security . the drafting and consultation of the basic law in view of our prevailing changes , many provisions in the basic law will have to be discussed again in order that the needs for social development can be better fulfilled . thus , there will be considerable work for the bldc and basic law consultative committee members . there is only nine months to go before the coming plenary meeting of npc which is to be held next year . if we fail to present this draft in time for scrutiny and endorsement by npc , the examination of the draft will probably be postponed until another npc meeting in the next session . it is hoped that the consultation and drafting work will be resumed as soon as possible to allow more time for discussion , scrutiny and a fresh review of the draft basic law , so that the basic law can be better formulated to the satisfaction of the people of the hong kong . sir , with these remarks , i support the motion . dr. tse : sir , over the past ten days or so , the people of hong kong experienced an unprecedented shock that worked on their emotion , mind and sentiments . the feelings of the hong kong people were stirred as they watched the development of the student movement in beijing and the changes in the chinese ruling hierarchy . this not only shows the close blood relationship among the chinese but also highlights the intimate relation between the future of hong kong and the political outlook in china . during the recent mass rallies and marches of unprecedented scale , the people of hong kong showed their noble sentiments , discipline , unity and generosity which we should all be proud of . furthermore , it has proved that hong kong people have the potential for a high degree of autonomy . judging from the angle of civic education , the impacts brought about by this student movement , using the jargons of martial art stories , have activated a stream of vitality in civic awareness of our community which was kept in a dormant state for many years . this stream of vitality in civic awareness can now circulate smoothly in the mind of people from different sectors . if we make good use of this opportunity to strengthen the awareness and knowledge of the public on democratic rights and obligations , to show more concern about the society and to take proper action in building a community with a stronger sense of belonging and solidarity in the development of a representative government , i believe in the next few years we will be able to establish gradually a political structure with wide representation to take up the responsibilities and meet the challenges when hong kong becomes a special administrative region with a high degree of autonomy . it is on this belief that most of the kowloon city district board members and i support the consensus recently reached by the omelco members on the formation of the legislature . sir , the purpose of kowloon city district board members in supporting the omelco proposal is not to strive for a faster pace in the introduction of confrontation politics in the formation of the legislature . as a matter of fact , no one can accurately forecast which option will be most suitable to cope with the situation in hong kong by 1997 . none the less , with the political awakening of the public , i believe that given a reasonable timetable for progress , the people of hong kong will have the ability and determination to speed up the adaptation process to meet the demand of the times and to elect legislators who can represent the overall interest of hong kong through direct election at an earlier date . for the same reason , we also agree to another mainstream opinion of the omelco in - house meeting that if we have a sound and open nomination system , the chief executive can also be elected by universal suffrage not later than 2003 so as to tie in with the development of the legislature . however , a district board member pointed out during the process of consultation that if 50% of the members of the legislative council in 1997 is to be directly elected , according to the so - called " lo wu " model , the same percentage of elected elements would also be required in the 1995 legislative council election . according to the existing letters patent and royal instructions , if 50% or more legislative councillors are returned by general election , it may bring about fundamental changes to the constitutional status and legislative power of the legislative council . the district board member therefore opined that proper arrangement should be devised in this respect . one possible solution would be to introduce some changes to the composition of the legislative council for 1995-97 . while half of the elected seats will be returned by universal suffrage and the remaining half by functional constituencies , several seats should be reserved for the ex-officio members . in this way , the number of members returned by general election will still be less than 50% before 1997 . on the composition of the executive council and its relationship with the legislative council , most of the kowloon city district board members and i support the model proposed by the omelco in - house meeting . our views , however , are closer to those of the honourable allen lee in detail . we opine that major policy departments should be assisted by consultative committees . chairmen of these committees who will be appointed by the chief executive should also be members of the legislative and executive councils . in future , if secretaries of the departments do not accept the majority views of these consultative committees in formulating policies or making decisions of great importance , they have to submit substantial explanations to the executive council for consideration . such arrangement will ensure that government officials will have to fulfil their duty in policy making . at the same time , chairmen of the consultative committees will , as legislative councillors , be indirectly accountable to the public for monitoring the decisions of the government . furthermore , we consider that consultative committees should also be set up to monitor the formulation of policies concerning financial , legal and security issues . chairmen of these committees should be members of the executive council . they should not be legislative councillors in order to ensure that their professional advice is provided without having to take into account their political elections . sir , the aforesaid are my opinions as well as those of the majority of the kowloon city district board members on the development of political structure in the draft basic law . with these remarks , i support the motion . mr. edward ho : in the 1930s , the famous long march changed the history of china . some 50 years later , on sunday , 21 may 1989 ( and again on 28 may 1989 ) , hong kong had its own long march . almost a million people , young and old , from all walks of life , marched through the streets of hong kong in a peaceful demonstration , with a unity of purpose , supporting the student movement in china in the call for democracy and freedom . never in the history of hong kong was there such a free and spontaneous demonstration of solidarity of such a magnitude for a common cause . the people of hong kong have finally and unequivocally demonstrated that they can unite together when there are issues that are of deep concern to them . sir , in my speech on the basic law in this chamber last july , i pleaded for consensus in our community on the basic law especially in relation to the shaping of our future government . for a while , i did not believe it was possible , but events in the past few weeks have given me the belief that , given the will , consensus is not beyond our reach . this belief has been further reinforced by the consensus that members of the executive and legislative councils were able to reach on some key issues on the political structure in the basic law . these have been enumerated by our senior legislative council member mr. allen lee . i shall not repeat them , but i shall rather cover briefly several other aspects of the draft basic law . despite our concern over the current unsettling situation in china which no doubt will influence our thinking on the basic law , the basic law is not about the present . instead , it will prescribe the political , economic and social systems to be practised in the hong kong special administrative region for 50 years after 1997 . the basic law should ensure that the provisions contained in the sino - british joint declaration be maintained , and that our present lifestyles and systems would remain essentially unchanged , and that hong kong 's prosperity and stability shall continue up to the year 2047 , and hopefully beyond . sir , the point that i am now going to make has already been covered by mr. andrew wong but as i feel very strongly about it , i shall nevertheless make it again . the preamble of the basic law has stated two very important principles : 1. that the establishment of the hksar will be in accordance with the provisions of article 31 of the constitution of the people 's republic of china , and 2. that the basic policies of the people 's republic of china regarding hong kong have been elaborated by the chinese government in the sino - british joint declaration . to me , these two cardinal principles are absolutely crucial as they provide the framework for the whole of the basic law . they provide the precepts to future interpretations of the basic law . therefore , the preamble should be an integral part of the basic law , having the same legal effect as the body of the basic law . in regard to the first principle : although having the status of a special administrative region , hong kong will be an integral part of the people 's republic of china , and hence its basic law would be governed by the constitution of china . under the principle of " one country , two systems " , i question whether the provision of article 31 of the constitution alone , as it stands , provides sufficient authority and clarity that there will not be any conflict between the basic law and the constitution . in parallel with the efforts to draft the basic law , i urge that the chinese government should examine this very important aspect of the constitution in detail . the slightest uncertainty can lead to chaos in the years to come . in reading the draft basic law , it is difficult to construct in one 's mind a model of government that would , on the one hand , have the necessary checks and balances between the executive and the legislative authorities of the government to prevent the abuse of power , and on the other hand , that the executive authorities would have the necessary support from the legislature for the proper and effective functioning of a stable government . i therefore endorse the proposals on the relationship between the executive and the legislative authorities which have been agreed amongst members of the executive and legislative councils . again , these proposals have been ably explained by mr. allen lee in his speech . it cannot be denied that the most important and controversial elements of the basic law are the method of the selection of the chief executive and the formation of the legislative council . in our attempt to reach consensus , the following factors have emerged : 1. that the people of hong kong want full democracy , that is , universal franchise , as the ultimate goal , 2 . that the move towards that goal should be evolutionary and gradual to avoid disruption to our political stability ; in this , sir , i have the concurrence of my honourable colleague prof. c.k. poon , 3. that whilst the pace of development of democracy should relate to the political maturity of the people , a clear timetable for such development will provide a much - needed certainty ; this certainty will in turn forge a faster pace in the development of political maturity , 4. that in the pursuit of democracy as an abstract ideal , the unique nature of hong kong as a special administrative region in a " one country , two systems " situation and its complex layers of political , economic and social infrastructure that have given rise to its success as a vibrant economy , an international financial and tourist centre , and a vital industrial base should be recognized ; sir , my honourable colleague mr. ngai shiu - kit has asked me to express his concurrence in this , 5. that whatever the model , it has to be accepted by all sectors of our community who combine to contribute to the prosperity and stability of hong kong , and 6. that hong kong people shall govern hong kong under the principle of " one country , two systems " . in any society , there will be inequalities of wealth and unequal opportunities . but the essence of capitalism is a well - functioning competitive market which engenders overall economic growth , and it is only through economic growth that opportunities can be provided to the common man . in fact , liberal democracy requires a market economy . there should be no hindrance and conflicts of interest for all sectors of our community to arrive at a consensus . and the timing for such a consensus is now ! with these remarks , sir , i support the motion . suspension of sitting his excellency the president : that concludes today 's session . in accordance with standing orders i suspend the council until 2.30 pm tomorrow afternoon . suspended accordingly at twenty - four minutes past six o'clock .

( laughter ) madam president , first of all , i would like to tell a true story . in 1991 , when the government commenced works on the chek lap kok airport , many families had been engaging in farming at the site already . however , one of the families was reluctant to give up farming when their land was resumed . after a great deal of hardships , they found a plot in yuen long to continue farming , though , of course , it was a plot much smaller than what they previously had . this family , together with the dogs they kept , moved to yuen long . one of the dogs , missing the old home and finding it hard to adapt to the new environment , kept barking every night and refused to eat for a whole week . it subsequently died of starvation . at the same time , given the great difference in air quality between yuen long and the pollution free island , the old farmer also developed respiratory problem after moving to yuen long and became very depressed and eventually died . there are innumerable cases where the living of the citizens is affected as a result of the resumption of land by the government . the story above shows just the tip of an iceberg . ordinary citizens , like ants , are powerless to put up a fight . in the whole process of land resumption , not only had such issues as compensation and the timing for removal given rise to conflicts between the government and the citizens , the lack of resettlement had also been the cause of anger amongst the citizens , factory owners and shop operators . not long ago , when the government had to resume land for the flood prevention works at river indus , farmers from the surrounding villages who were not satisfied with the compensation and resettlement arrangement got into clashes with the police . similarly , when wah kai industrial centre in tsuen wan had to be cleared for the west rail project , the series of protests by the owners and factory operators turned the problem white - hot . the current land resumption policy of the government is based on the relevant legal provisions , for example , the statutory powers provided by the lands resumption ordinance , roads ( works , use and compensation ) ordinance and railways ordinance , so that private land can be resumed for public projects or railways , while easement and other rights can be created on private land . those ordinances provide that the authorities would put forth compensation proposals to those eligible and affected by the resumption , but if they find the proposals unacceptable , they may claim statutory compensation . when the authorities order resumption of land under any ordinance , it will publish a notice in the gazette and the notice will usually last for three months , from the date of the notice . on expiration of the notice period , the land concerned will be reverted to the possession of the government . there are two major issues relating to land resumption and factory relocation . first , in relocating an enterprise , especially one that involves high technology and mechanical equipment , operators in general have to plan ahead and to arrange for sufficient time and finance to install all the equipment before operations can continue . strictly speaking , many owners and factory operators can only move out half a year after receipt of compensation , some may even take one or two years before they can make arrangements for moving out of the original factory . however , it is unreasonable of the government to ask the factory operators to move out within such a short notice , that is the three months ' notice mentioned above . moreover , the current amount of compensation is in fact not sufficient to enable the affected businesses to continue their operations . when the government resumes commercial properties , the end - user owners may be compensated with an amount commonly known as " premises shell price " , which is equivalent to the market value of other properties in the same district . other than this , occupiers of properties may also claim for disturbance compensation and compensation in respect of lost businesses or opt for ex gratia payment . the way the payment is calculated takes into account the rent during the removal period , removal expenses , decoration expenses , stamp duty and legal fees . the purpose of making this compensation is to simplify the administration work involved in land resumption so that construction projects can proceed promptly and smoothly while those affected will also find it more acceptable . i fully agree to the purpose and principle behind it , but i cannot bring myself to accept its actual implementation and the related arrangement , especially in relation to the fixing of the price . at the moment , the amount of compensation paid for a property is assessed and calculated by the surveyors of lands department . as the method of calculation involves a lot of technical problems , the government has not provided any detail explanation to the owners as to how the price is set , thus seriously affecting the rights of the factory operators and owners . moreover , given the type of plant , interior installations and technical requirements involved , removal costs can vary greatly . the disturbance compensation flatly offered by the government cannot reflect the actual removal costs of the different factories . i can quote the case of the owner of an electroplating factory in wah kai as an example . in his plant , besides the $800,000 - worth of sewage treatment equipment that was required by the environmental protection department , there was an expensive electroplating tank . the equipment and interior installation for this type of factory would cost more than $1 million , but the government only paid disturbance compensation at a flat rate of $150 per feet , which definitely was not enough for the operator to find another factory to start his operation again . another administrative problem is about the procedure and timing for the release of compensation payment . it is the current practice of the lands department to resume the property for investigation , photo taking , video taking and calculation , before making a compensation proposal to the owner and operator . if the person concerned considers the compensation unreasonable , he can make a claim to the lands department . if the department disputes the amount that the person claimed , the applicant will have to lodge an appeal with the lands tribunal . though the lands tribunal expresses that a hearing will usually take place three months after an application is made , actually counting from the time after making an application to the completion of the relevant proceedings , a case may take as long as two years . thus , on the one hand , the release of compensation would take too long ; on the other hand , the operators might face financial difficulties because their business is stopped and they lack the financial means for removal to resume business . the claim by the government that the factory operators can obtain bank loans to temporarily foot the removal bill not only shows that it does not want to take up the responsibility of helping the operators , but also exposes its ignorance of and indifference to the current business environment . with the industrial sector now declining , if the operators are not able to provide their goodwill for security , banks usually would not approve of any mortgage . even theoretically the owners and operators can apply to the lands department for compensation in respect of the interest cost on the loans , if they cannot provide the necessary support for the loans , any " compensation " would become meaningless and removal would be out of the question . from the wah kai incident it can be seen that many years have been spent on planning the northwestern railway , but severe mishandling is revealed in land resumption that caused the operators to be treated unreasonably . in fact , had proper administrative arrangement been made by the government to ensure that the owners and operators could first be reasonably compensated for relocation and resumption of business , clashes between the government and the public could be avoided and there is also no need for the operators to fold up . to minimize the effect of land resumption on the operators , the government should follow the principle of " first compensation , then removal " instead of sticking to the practice of " first compensation , then claims " . past experience tells us that if businesses , especially those in the heavy industry and special industries , were to be relocated , they have to spend a lot of money and time . hence , the government and the operators must go through repeated discussions so that they can have sufficient time to reach agreements on problems relating to compensation and removal . besides adhering to the principle of " first compensation , then removal " , the government , i think , should be more proactive in helping the affected operators to find new premises for relocation . in the seventies and eighties , when the former district office was in charge of the administration of land , the government had helped many factory operators in the new territories to search for other sites for relocation so that the government could resume their land for development . i can quote a living example . in 1979 , in order to construct the mass transit railway in tsuen wan , properties at sai lau kok , tsuen wan had to be cleared . there were operators of chinese wine factories , foundries , and the like . as factory buildings were unable to accommodate such operations , they had to look for some flat level sites for relocation . with the assistance of the district office , 23 of the operators were arranged to move to the hillside above route twisk , that is district 40 now , to continue their operation . now 19 years since then , and after informing the operators at district 40 that the land rented for their operation was to be resumed for developing low - density residential properties , the government subsequently auctioned off the land . however , the government expressed that other than paying the ordinary compensation , it was not obliged to provide any assistance to these operators , who were just to pack up and leave . while 20 years ago , officials of the district office under the british hong kong government could take the trouble to look for relocation for the factory operators , the sar officials now , oblivious to the sufferings of the public , only said that they could only act as what the law has provided and carry out orders from their superiors . as to the amount of compensation , i suggest that the government should amend the method for calculating the disturbance compensation . different levels of compensation can be fixed in accordance with the type of businesses and the financial requirements for relocation . the amount of compensation paid should increase proportionally with levels . for example , given that the costs of machinery and equipment installation are higher for some high - tech industries , relocation costs should be higher . the disturbance compensation paid for land resumption should also be increased accordingly . before resuming any land , the government should carry out comprehensive and in - depth survey of the affected operators . in fact , the government has already carried out work in this area , and to a certain extent it should have some understanding and assessment of the financial needs of the operators if they are to relocate . the government may also make reasonable compensation payment with reference to the needs of the operators , which should not pose any technical problems . moreover , with regard to the mechanism for claiming compensation and instituting appeals , i propose that the government should set up an independent and fair land adjudication mechanism to provide free litigation service in relation to land and property price adjudication . such a mechanism not only can reduce the financial burden of the operators , but can also minimize the delay in litigation as well as the frustration and financial pressure that the operators may suffer when their litigation may drag on for years . based on precedent cases , it can be seen that the case of shiu wing steel is the most successful in land resumption and received the best treatment from the government . in 1991 , the government announced that rennie hill was to be cleared and that the site occupied by shiu wing was to be partitioned for residential use . given that shiu wing had substantial contribution to hong kong 's industries , the government had not only made a compensation of $650 million , but had also granted it , in the form of private agreement , a site in tuen mun to rebuild its plant . this is a very preferential treatment . of course , a land premium has to be paid for that site in tuen mun . however , if contribution to hong kong economy should be a merit for consideration , are those operators at wah kai not also the core of hong kong 's manufacturing industries ? moreover , of those operators affected by the clearance of district 40 in tsuen wan , many have also contributed to hong kong economy . madam president , success does not come by as a matter of course . hong kong 's economic success relies on the contribution of all trades and businesses , especially that of the small and medium enterprises . it would be an inexcusable crime if the small and medium enterprises were nipped out of their existence . with these remarks , madam president , i beg to move . mr albert chan moved the following motion : ( translation ) " that , as the resumption of land by the government for infrastructural projects or development will affect the original agricultural , industrial or commercial development on the land and will even lead to the closure of many enterprises , this council urges the government to expeditiously review the compensation policy on land resumption and the relevant administrative arrangements in order to assist as far as possible the operators who are affected by the resumption and reduce its impact on them , thereby ensuring that they can continue with or resume their operations . " president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by mr albert chan be passed . mr lau wong - fat : madam president , i must first declare that i am one of the owners of land title in hong kong . since the return of hong kong to china and the coming into effect of the basic law , article 105 of the basic law provides for a new criteria in respect of compensation for lands resumption , that is , the compensation offered for resumed property should be equivalent to the current actual value of the property . however , the government has still adhered to the lands resumption ordinance , which is the former crown lands resumption ordinance , as the basis for compensation . the mechanism provided is very restrictive and unreasonable , especially section 12 ( c ) . for years heung yee kuk has been working hard for the interests of the titleholders , but the authorities just stay unmoved , insisting that the potential value , accessibility , area and surroundings of land are not factors for consideration in relation to compensation , thus resulting in a wide gap between the amount of compensation put forth by the government and the market value . heung yee kuk learns that in the recent judicial review of a case about land resumption compensation at the high court and in two cases heard by the lands tribunal , it has been determined that section 12 ( c ) of the lands resumption ordinance is no longer applicable , and that the potential value , accessibility , area and surroundings of lands must be considered for the calculation of compensation . thus , in the future , the government must abide by the provision of article 105 of the basic law and the relevant case laws to calculate the actual value of lands . the best way is for the government to draw up a new formula for calculating compensation and to set up the relevant compensation mechanism after conducting a general consultation that involves heung yee kuk , so that there is something to go by when land is to be resumed . madam president , after hong kong 's return to china , heung yee kuk has on a number of occasions asked the government to invoke article 105 of the basic law as the basis for calculating land resumption compensation . however , the government considered that there was no need for any change ; and the titleholders were thus misled into believing that the compensation offered by the government was reasonable and legal , and subsequently into signing the compensation agreement , without seeking any review by the lands tribunal . heung yee kuk therefore asks the government to rectify the situation so that for all land resumption cases after 1 july 1997 and that were compensated in accordance with section 12 ( c ) , compensation should be made in accordance with article 105 of the basic law and the case laws mentioned above ; moreover , the titleholders should be paid the difference and interest to make up the full compensation . madam president , while practising colonial rule in hong kong , the former british hong kong government inevitably neglected the interests of the locals . even though those affected by land resumption might lose all their possessions and assets , the compensation given for resumption and relocation was always calculated in accordance with the policy already in force . past cases include constructing reservoirs , cutting water sources , preventing farmers to farm on their own land , leaving land unused , which forced many residents of the new territories to leave their homes and work overseas . recent cases include land resumption at thirteen villages in kowloon where home factory operators , being unable to provide proof of profit as a result of the change in economy on their operation , could only receive compensation that was significantly lower , and some even received nothing , thus forcing them to fold up their operation . the compensation policy as currently adopted by the government was drawn up some 20 years ago ( that is , in 1978 ) with reference to the report of the study committee on resuming urban land in the new territories ( or the " kenneth kan report " for short ) , and was based on the distance and categorization as shown in the new town blueprints . undoubtedly , as the policy was pertinent to the actual situation in the new territories then ( there was yet to be any policy on town planning ) , its implementation was quite effective . however , time has changed , in 1991 when the government forcibly include general land use planning in the new territories in the town planning ordinance , the uniqueness of lands at the new territories was officially abolished . in other words , the policy of new town blueprint for the new territories exists only in name now . so why , in making relocation compensation as a result of land resumption , does the government adhere to the criteria set more than 20 years ago , instead of working on the basis of planned land use and the potential value of land ? i think that the current policy for calculating such compensation is outdated and unreasonable , it even has a smack of the government robbing properties from private citizens . since the high court and the lands tribunal have already established the criteria for calculating compensation as a result of land resumption , the time is apt to review the related policy . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion of mr albert chan . miss chan yuen - han : madam president , as the wording of the motion focuses mainly on discussing businesses affected by the government 's land resumption , which include the development of agriculture , industries and commerce , we should therefore focus on the condition of those operators , factories or shops affected by land resumption . now on exhibition at the thematic gallery of the hong kong heritage museum is " hong kong comic world " , which , through the lively and interesting comic world , shows the development of the society of hong kong , and the reconstructed street stalls help us recollect memories of the past social culture of hong kong . however , what lies behind this sea of changes is the loss of hong kong 's geographical and regional characteristics . the life of our agricultural , industrial and commercial developments have been sapped by the government 's uniform and lifeless development model . much of our tradition has gone . furthermore , in the course of hong kong 's development , land belongs to the government , which may , under the lands resumption ordinance , resume land from lessees for development . however , on being leased , land becomes private property , in which citizens or operators may have lived and operated for decades . the decision of the government to resume lands and properties would have profound effect on them . the above two points ( i would only concentrate on these two , as i might have to talk for a long time if all the details were covered ) can be summed up as our regret that the one - dimensional social development has destroyed our pluralistic social culture and caused some traditional businesses to fold up and traditional art to disappear under the giant wheel of history . another issue that has been my concern and that also been aching me is that in the course of development , land resumption has resulted in many clashes between the government and the public . when the government has to resume land for development , the public , instead of objecting to the resumption , can only dispute the amount of compensation and the loss of business . how can we have one single ruler to measure the amount of compensation and loss of business ? both the public and the government have their own criteria , and very often conflicts are the result of such differences . madam president , from cases of land resumption by the land development corporation to the public clashes over wah kai industrial centre , one can see that the government could have been more open and shown more human concern in its compensation policy and administrative arrangement . in fact , any resumption of property right by the government is an invasion of an occupier 's ownership or lease right and the disturbance caused to the occupier and operator should be minimized so that they can continue with their operation . however , in a recent case of land resumption , some of the affected operators or traditional family businesses expressed that the current ex gratia payment was inadequate for them to rebuild their families and businesses . madam president , from the clearance of tai hom tsuen and tung tau cottage area and the redevelopment of old district and public housing estates , with which i am quite familiar , i have a very strong and bad feeling about the actions involved . the government only cared about resuming land for development , without any regard to the living space of those small operators . in fact , there are two areas in the lands resumption ordinance that i find very inadequate . first , according to the ordinance , claimants of statutory compensation must provide document proof , which will put greater burden on the administrative procedures , thus complicating the process of compensation application . take for example the case of tung tau cottage area , which was very similar with that of rennie 's mill , residents of both districts were emigrants from china after the war and had established their homes here . while , because of some political factors at rennie 's mill , the government might have to give political consideration to these at rennie 's mill in its decision - making , there were no such considerations in the case of tung tau cottage area . residents of both districts met the conditions for applying to the government for land to rebuild their homes and should be compensated in the same way when their sites were cleared . however , the government required them to produce documentary proof , and in the legislative council , we could see at that time the historical background of those affected by the resumption . all political parties of the legislative council unanimously agreed that the government should give basically reasonable compensation to those affected by the clearance . despite so , madam president , we regret that up to this moment , the government still insists that those residents had not produced the required documentary proof . madam president , just imagine those post-war days back in the fifties , other than government officials , would ordinary citizens have a say ? despite that the government has time and again changed its policies , the citizens could hardly put up a fight , and now these people were asked to produce documentary proof . to be frank , even the government department at that time also questioned the reason for the difference in treatment for these two similar cottage sites . this clearly showed that the government just neglected the existence of this group of people . not only so , it has even coldly pointed out that those affected would not be given any compensation if they could not produce any documentary proof . notwithstanding that the legislative council had repeatedly passed motions that these people should be given the same treatment in relation to compensation , the government still stuck to its ground . these questions made my colleagues and me feel rather furious . moreover , i would also like to point out another area of inadequacy in the lands resumption ordinance and that is , it shows no human concern . other than the compensation as provided by law for the owners or tenants affected by resumption , the government has not provided any land or found suitable sites for the operators to continue with their businesses . in fact , in the course of making compensation , the government had created a number of blunders . factories were given the same compensation no matter if they were of the heavy industry or light industry ; retail shops would even be compensated much more than the compensation for the industries . on these issues , it seems that we were having an ongoing struggle with the government . after repeated clearance incidents , why does the government still remain the same as it was ? why , after every clearance or redevelopment , would the government leave some small operators with an inability to continue with their business , making them join the league of the unemployed ? why must it be like this ? why , with the unemployment situation deteriorating , must the government still be so unreasonable with some of its policies ? madam president , some of the comics on displayed at the hong kong heritage museum created a montage of shops of the old days with street scenes of the present day . however , i cannot see if there would be any chance for traditional businesses to continue their operations under the current lands resumption ordinance when the government redevelops the communities . hong kong will only have the single mall - type operations in the future , and will be lacking in the pluralism of our culture and economy . all these are nipped by the government . if , in course of the land resumption , the government would not give consideration on a people - oriented basis , that would , i think , become a very sad state of affairs . unlike other countries or cities , we would no longer have a pluralistic and lively culture . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . thank you . mr kenneth ting : madam president , with the economy on the growth , the number of cases where land was resumed for infrastructure works and development would increase accordingly . many of the factory operators affected by land resumption are small and medium enterprises ( smes ) and have been operating on their premises for quite some time already . given the huge investment that is made in the production equipment and machinery , a land resumption order would mean complete evaporation of the years of effort that these operators put into running their factories . under the current economic condition , however , it is easier said than done if an operator could rebuild his business with the amount of compensation that can hardly reflect the actual loss ! hoping that they could obtain reasonable compensation , many factory operators held protracted talks with the government , but still the result was that they were forced to close down . i want to specifically point out that it was not only the operators who had to suffer , but their employees too , who were forced to join the league of the unemployed , with a series of foreseeable social and family problems tagging behind . though , in the resumption of land , it is the purpose of the government to achieve a better result for the economy as a whole , the process of land resumption just worked the other way , making it difficult for the affected factory operators to resume business , and indirectly causing damage to the economic and social interests of hong kong . on the amount of compensation , the sum that the government paid for the land and properties resumed was very low , which very often could not reflect the current market value . the owners were forced to sell their properties at an exceptionally cheap price , or had to engage professionals or surveyors to haggle with the government before the government could make a little budge on the price . all these make one feel that the government is trying to intimidate the small owners . on estimating the loss of business , though there is no legislation that expressly provides for a calculation formula , the profitability of a business , as shown in past court cases , has been used as the criteria . however , since the financial crisis , the performance of ordinary smes has been far from satisfactory , in fact , many of them are even struggling for survival . the assessment of any loss of business would as a result tend to be too low , making the compensation completely unrepresentative of the actual loss and greatly raising the possibility for these operators to fold up . on the determination of special allowance , using a per - foot rate to calculate the lump sum compensation does not take into account the equipment and installation characteristics of the individual industries . take an electronics factory as an example , the cost involved in relocating a production line is completely different from that of relocating any ordinary machinery . some of these machines , if taken apart , are very hard to put back again ; some of these equipment even have to be replaced anew . how can the loss be properly compensated with that small amount of removal payment ? to the ordinary smes , the most severe blow is the uncertainty in the timing of land resumption , which often drives smes into financial crisis and subsequently down the path of complete closing down . very often , long before the government has gazetted the resumption of a plot of land , the banks have already learned of such resumption and , expecting that these enterprises would have lost their " brick and mortar " , would reduce the loan finance to the smes concerned . without the support of the banks , it is not uncommon for these smes to fold up before even removal . the various departments of the government should in their administration try to minimize the uncertainty in the timing for land resumption , and a notice of land resumption should be gazetted as soon as possible so that the affected operators can have a clear notion of the timing and have more time in arranging the finance , operation , removal and resumption of business . as soon as land resumption is to go ahead , the government should handle the operators ' application for compensation as quickly as possible . should the lands department be understaffed in this area , consideration must be given to outsourcing the work concerned to avoid any unnecessary delay . in a word , the government should review its formula and mechanism for calculating and determining compensation for land resumption , especially in relation to the making of ex gratia payment for industrial properties so that the compensation the owners get can be more reasonable and reflect the actual loss . despite that the government may not have the absolute responsibility to assist the affected operators to resume or continue with their operations , the liberal party considers that the government , while resuming land for public use , must also take into account the private property right of the owners and the effect of land resumption on their businesses , and render as much assistance as it can to those operators who want to continue with their business to resume operation . this will help clear some of the resentment among the public . at the same time , the government should also minimize the economic loss arising from land resumption , thereby avoiding aggravating the unemployment problem . with these remarks , i support the motion . mr wong sing - chi : madam president , the discussion on a review of the compensation policy for land resumption brought back to me a lot of memories . at the end of 1999 , when i was giving assistance to some powerless residents of shek wu san tsuen , i was arrested for obstructing the police . i was subsequently found by the court to be just a mediator , who was assisting the residents to conduct reasonable and proper negotiations with the government . i was just a go - between . notwithstanding this outcome , i still had to put aside a lot of important work and attend the court for a month 's hearing . however , the plight of the residents was even worse . there was a mr shi , who , with the arrangement of the government , obtained a five - year lease on a plot of land . he spent $1 million on decoration and put in a lot of planning for a beautiful house . the government told him that he could live there free of any disturbance for five years , and that the lease could be renewed for another five years . however , two years later , the government told him that the land was to be resumed and a year later the house was demolished . for the million - dollar decoration , the government said that it would only pay a compensation of $100,000 . mr shi 's family of five originally was living happily together , but under such a situation , he was forced to fight back . regrettably , because he had resorted to using a little force during a struggle , he was arrested by the police and charged with obstructing the police . mr shi was then given a 12 - month sentence and he is still in prison . i have visited him and he asked me that i must give an account of the incident in the legislative council . up to this moment , mr shi still cannot obtain any reasonable compensation . the government has only paid him $110,000 . not only is the money he spent on decorating his house has gone forever , his family is also greatly affected by the incident . as mr albert chan has already pointed out , what we discuss today is mainly on how industries and businesses are affected by the government 's land resumption . apparently , it is impossible for large - scale factories like chinese wine breweries and smelters to move into factory buildings , as they require large open space for their operations . many operators apply to the government for lands in the new territories to construct their factories , but in the course of application they often meet with all sorts of obstacles . under the existing policy , the operators concerned may apply for short term waiver , or " stw " for short , from the lands department , so that private land can temporarily be used for industrial purpose . the lands department usually takes nine months to approve , and other departments like the environmental protection department also have to carry out assessment to ensure that the operations meet the environmental protection legislations . in fact , operators who have experience in these matters told us that the government would usually reject their applications . an operator in the ship - repairing business told me that he had applied to the lands department for an stw , hoping that he could open his factory in hung shui kiu or tsuen wan , but was rejected because the government planned to develop an environmental new town , hence industrial land use was restricted . as to land use in tsuen wan , because of a catchment area in the vicinity , factory land use was also rejected . though there were good sites in the northern district , given that the ship repairing trade had to use high - temperature smelters and heavy equipment , any flood in the district could affect the operator 's livelihood or even cause industrial accident . the operator finally had to give up the idea . also in the case of shek wu san tsuen , there was a large wood furniture factory with over a hundred workers . on resuming the property of the factory , the government only compensated it with the price of that plot of land . despite that the factory would like to apply for another piece of land in the new territories to rebuild its operations so that the workers could continue with their work , the government only told the factory that it could make the application and up to this moment the application is yet to be approved . for those small and medium enterprises that would very much like to continue with their operation but for the shortage of land , the government should , i think , actively provide land information to them , like information on rural land use for both government and private land in hong kong , so that the operators can apply land from the government or purchase land from land owners for relocation . this way , it will enable the operators and workers to continue with their occupation . the government should also list any restriction on future land use for lands in the vicinity of industrial sites so that the operators can make their choice appropriately . in order to minimize the conflict between industrial development and environmental protection , the government should encourage the operators to choose sites from areas that have been marked for industrial use . for example , the area around tong yan san tsuen , ping shan is devoted mainly to industrial use like workshop , open - air storage or warehouse . while benefiting the operators economically , this can also avoid the mixing of industrial and commercial land use with residential land use , which may affect all concerned . in fact , the most important thing is for the government to shorten the approval time and to co-ordinate the work of various departments so that the application and approval procedure for short term waiver can be simplified . as long as the environment and the living of the residents are not affected , the government should help the operators find appropriate sites to continue their businesses . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . mr leung yiu - chung : madam president , i gather my experience about land resumption actions taken by the government mainly from a number of cases : first , at wah kai industrial centre of tsuen wan ; second , at hung shui kiu ; and third , at tuen mun and yuen long . the experience , as many members have already talked about , shows the sort of problems the government is having in general when it resumes land : first , complex procedure ; second , messy administration ; and third , inadequate relocation and compensation . if the government has still refused to look squarely at these problems , and given that the government is now actively launching a number of engineering and other development projects , it would , i am afraid , aggravate the public 's grumbles and grievances towards the government . just now mr wong sing - chi has quoted a number of cases ; in fact , i have also a whole host of cases to quote . the one i have the deepest memory of is that of a farmer at hung shui kiu . he did not have the slightest idea that his farmland would be resumed by the government . he went to the agriculture , fisheries and conservation department ( afcd ) to apply for a farm licence . on being issued the licence , he spent one to two million dollars on renovation and a lot of other facilities . however , before the renovation work was completed , the government told him that his land was to be resumed . his situation was very pitiable . the government had said that it had conducted thorough consultation , and consulted the views of the residents and held press conferences . such so - called consultation was a complete fake . why i say it was fake ? it is because there were only residents listening to the government , but not for the government listening to the views of the residents . no matter what the residents had said , the government just turned a deaf ear . the government subsequently said that it had already held meetings with them and the matter was submitted to a certain committee for discussion . in fact , during the discussion , the government simply repeated the residents ' views , for example , relating that they objected , but it could not relate the true reasons for their objection . finally , on the grounds of public interest , a decision was reached . investments had really been made and facilities bought , what was the investors to do with all these ? as to compensation , of course , as mr wong sing - chi has said , it was far from satisfactory . the result was a very harsh one : the farmer could not have time to sell off his thousands of pigeons , which subsequently had to be gassed by officials from the afcd . what a cruel thing they had done ! it was very easy for the government to say that if the residents were not satisfied with the compensation , they could appeal . however , we all know that ( i will touch on this later ) lodging an appeal is a gruelling process , so to the ordinary citizens this action is virtually futile . with land resumption , the government has in its hand that imperial sword - the lands resumption ordinance . it can do whatever it wants , without any room for negotiation . though , when deciding on resuming a plot of land , it might have discussions and hold meetings , they are mere work of fa��ade . the government would only say that as the time has come , it has to resort to the ordinance to resume the land concerned , and if the residents were not happy , they could litigate . look at the wah kai incident , instead of going to litigation , the operators only sought a judicial review , but the expense involved was hard to calculate . up to this moment , there are still operators being sued by the west rail for legal fees because they had instituted proceedings . it is really like getting thirty spanks before even seeing the judge . they really do not have the means to litigate with the government over compensation . you can all see how harsh the result is when the government resorts to invoking the lands resumption ordinance . the government said that if anyone is not happy with the compensation , he can bring the matter to the lands tribunal . i would like to use the wah kai incident as an example again . this incident took place about a year ago , but it took the lands tribunal more than a year to begin hearing the case . with the vast amount of public funds at its disposal , the government need not worry about how long a case might drag on , but the operators do not have such resources . there was a case where the operator was only trying to recover tens of thousands dollars , but during the first three days of the lands tribunal hearing , the government lawyer only put questions to the operator about his business more than 10 years ago . the case dragged on for more than 10 days and had not yet come to the core of the matter . just imagine , as a claimant , he cannot guarantee that he would win the case and therefore would have to consider the consequences . after more than 10 days ' hearing , how could he bear the lawyer 's fees , not to mention that he might have to pay the government 's legal fees as well ? he might not be able even to pay his own legal fees . he was not making a large claim , just some tens of thousands dollars , so what could he do ? he is still not very sure what he should do , and asked me a few days ago if he should press on with the case . the problem lies with the government in that there is no clear communication among the departments . how could a department have no knowledge that a certain piece of land was to be resumed within a short period of time ? the residents have arranged their living or work according to their own plans , but the result was what have shown up now . i feel that miss chan yuen - han 's " people - oriented basis " is well said . but what is considered to be a " people - oriented basis " ? when the land development corporation became urban renewal authority , the government had considered a number of issues and would very often listen to the views of those affected and show some concern for community development . however , in the cases of land resumption in the past , the government had not considered these issues in any way . can the factory operators continue their business ? can the residents continue living in the same district ? the government had not given any consideration to these issues . it just pressed on with its land resumption action , caring not a bit about the views of the residents . if rehousing were required , it would be for the housing department to handle , or it would be for the residents to find a solution themselves ; it has never been a concern for the government to co-ordinate the work of various departments . i feel that the government must give serious thoughts to this and should not allow work to be split up among so many departments . under the present circumstances , those in charge of rental would only look at the rental business , while those in charge of compensation would only look at compensation issues , thus resulting in a mess . i hope that the government can take a one - stop shop approach to these problems and that would be much better . president : mr leung , your time is up . mr lau ping - cheung : madam president , first of all may i declare my interest . i represent the construction , surveying and town - planning functional constituency and i am a professional surveyor myself . assessing land and property value is part of the work of a professional surveyor . i am also on the board of the urban renewal authority . despite its small size , hong kong is home to 6.8 million people . to adequately provide clothing , food , shelter and transport for this number of people , it is necessary to continue our programmme of development and construction . and in the course of development and construction , land must inevitably be acquired from private citizens . under the premise of public interest , i recognize that individual titleholders are forced to make a certain sacrifice . however , these individuals must also be given reasonable compensation . now the question is , what is reasonable compensation ? can we or can we not set down any objective standard for calculating a reasonable compensation ? it is only after we have an objective standard for reasonable compensation then the party making the offer would not feel that the titleholders are making exhorting claims and the titleholders would not feel that they were robbed . now when the government or a public agency has to acquire private land , the compensation given basically is based on the market value of the land resumed . if compensation were simply based on the market value of the land concerned , it would be unfair to the titleholders of private land , as the value compensated has not taken into account the sacrifice they have made for the public . we might still remember when the last legislative council examined the urban renewal authority ordinance and when the finance committee examined the criteria for determining the home purchase allowance , the point of our argument in fact was on the compensation other than the market value . since we did not have a proper reason for that compensation , so the argument dwelled on whether compensation should be based on the age of the building as one of five years or seven years . moreover , different types of land are treated differently . like the residential units that i just mentioned , the owners could receive home purchase allowance , but no allowance was given in respect of industrial or commercial units . one explanation the government might give is that the affected businesses could apply for compensation for loss of business . however , many businesses could not provide a complete set of books to apply for the compensation . the key issue , however , is that there often seems to be a severe chasm between the government and the titleholder of commercial property over the valuation of the property concerned . many past cases show that even if the titleholders engaged professional surveyors to appraise the value of the units resumed , the government might not be willing to accept the result of the appraisal . there might be a lot of other issues involved . one of the commonest issues is that because the characteristics of certain shops may make them particularly suitable for certain businesses , the value of such shops would be raised . however , the government would not consider such a factor . for example , shops that have a higher ceiling may , if used for laundry , allow more clothes to be hung up , or some operators that need to operate heavy industrial machinery may , because of their special weight requirement on the floor , only find shops on the ground floor suitable , thus the value of such shops would accordingly be higher . on the controversies over property valuation , when the urban renewal authority ordinance was being examined by the last legislative council , the secretary for planning and land had promised that the director of lands department would issue a set of valuation guidelines . regrettably , it has been about a year since that promise was made , but nothing has realized . in fact , it is important to have a set of generally recognized standards , which at least provide a reference for both parties when appraising a property and help minimize any misunderstanding . i hope that this guideline can be issued as soon as possible . of course , under certain situation , even if the government were willing to compensate , the titleholder may still find it not acceptable , especially when the business run by titleholder is stable and making money . mr albert chan therefore added in his motion that the government be urged to review the relevant administrative arrangements in order to assist as far as possible the operators who are affected by the resumption , thereby ensuring that they can continue with their operations . now , in the new territories there are many businesses that require a lot of space for their operations , such as those related to container transport . once the need for development is identified , the government would begin the process of acquiring land and would not assist the operators to relocate and continue with their operations . as the land use for most of the new territories has been frozen , unless the operators illegally change the land use , it is very hard for them to find any suitable site to resume their operations . they are thus forced to close down . on the issue of compensation for land that its use has been frozen , though i originally would like to propose an amendment , madam president ruled that my amendment has exceeded the scope of the original motion , i therefore do not want to dwell on this further . however , i would like to point out that if the policy of freezing land use were not to be relaxed , the government would have very little room for administrative manoeuvring in relation to assisting the affected operators to continue with their businesses . i am not trying to create a dent for the businessmen with this proposal so that they can misuse the land in the new territories and cause damage to the rural environment of the new territories . in fact , freezing land use has not only caused loss to the titleholders , but has also left land lying barren . i would like to cite an example here . when the housing department cleared the squatter huts at diamond hill last february , a businessman grew orchids there . because of the clearance and the inability to find a suitable place for relocation , he subsequently closed down his business . madam president , i am not an orchid lover , but i do feel sorry when , as shown on tv , the orchids were scattered all around and being trampled on . growing orchids may be partly commercial and partly agricultural , but it certainly would not cause any great damage to the environment , so why not give it some exceptional consideration ? with these remarks , i support the motion . mr tommy cheung : madam president , when , for the purpose of infrastructure or development , the government has to acquire land , to those affected it would be futile to do anything as the popular saying goes : " if heaven wishes it to rain or your mother to remarry , there is no way to stop either of them " . however , the current arrangement has much to be desired and there are areas of unreasonableness . many operators are even forced to fold up their businesses , losing everything they have . i want to talk about the views of the business sector , especially those of the restaurant and catering sector . first of all , the government and some of the public corporations often use " public interest " as the excuse for acquiring land , but full consideration is given to the " public interest " when it comes to the policies for calculating compensation and making administrative arrangement . the current method for calculating compensation is just like " an iron sheet " , that is , the market value of the property or lease plus removal cost plus the severance pay for the workers . all operators were given compensation based on the same formula . such a rigid approach has not taken into account the special situation of different businesses , and some businesses may thus be treated unfairly . i think that the authority should consider setting up another mechanism whereby compensation is calculated with reference to the actual operating situation of different business , and those operators , affected by land resumption and forced to close down their businesses , are encouraged to resume operation in another district as soon as possible . take the restaurant business as an example , many of the installations in a restaurant , like air - conditioners , ventilation system , and refrigerators in the kitchen , are fixed to the wall and cannot be moved . on the other hand , shops like shoe shops or fashion boutiques can have their shoe racks , clothes wardrobes and hangers removed easily and re-used . i think that in calculating compensation , the government should consider the actual situation of different businesses , with special attention given to those businesses which have equipment and tools that cannot be removed and re-used . moreover , when a restaurant moves to a new place to continue operation , it has to apply for all the necessary licences again , which means a large sum of administrative and application fees . until it has obtained its business licence , a restaurant cannot operate . however , most restaurants employ a large number of staff . thus , while waiting for the government to issue the business licence , a restaurant would have to shoulder a hefty bill of rent and staff salaries . in fact , the restaurant industry has on a number of occasions reflected the above views to the government and the land development corporation ( ldc ) , but the situation shows no improvement . now , with the ldc becoming the urban renewal authority , i sincerely hope that the authority and other public agencies would , when calculating compensation for land resumption in the future , seriously consider these suggestions , so that some improvement can be seen in the existing policy on compensation and in the administrative arrangement . there is also one point i would like to raise . some of the affected business operators may opt to retire , while others would like to find a new place to continue with their operation . as the government encourages entrepreneurship and employment , it can treat these two types of cases separately when it is to consider the amount of compensation . for those who are to continue with their operations , they may get a preferential compensation , which can be seen as an incentive for them to continue with their operation and help them create more jobs for the locals . madam president , the liberal party understands that the compensation offered for land resumption can never satisfy everyone . when it comes to using public funds , the government would never be too generous . the result would be the one who pays would never want to pay more , and the one who gets paid would always find the payment insufficient . between making payment and receiving payment , the government must find a balance by giving consideration to the special mode of operations of different industries . the restaurant industry is not asking the government to raise the compensation to a level so that an operator can carry out renovation and put in a new set of equipment . i propose to set up a mechanism for calculating the rate of depreciation so that the residual life of all equipment can be calculated and a reasonable compensation be made . moreover , an operator must be encouraged to find another place to continue operation and keep hong kong employed . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . mr tam yiu - chung : madam president , many of the public works in recent years involve acquisition of urban land by the government to construct transport , housing and community facilities so that the quality of life of the citizens can be improved . however , in acquiring land , the government has often caused much controversies and disputes and may even force small business owners to close down their operation or dismiss their employees . as the old saying goes : " pull one hair and the whole body would be affected , " so given that the small enterprises are running on a limited capital and small staff and that the economy is pretty slow , they would easily be forced to give up their operations if , when being asked to move by the government , they are not given sufficient compensation and assistance . the clearance of wah kai industrial centre at tsuen wan not long ago , which drew much resistance from the factory operators concerned , is a typical example . among the 358 factories at wah kai , as many as half of them , that is , a total of 176 of them , considered that the compensation given by the government was not sufficient to cover their loss and had to make a claim . however , from 1999 up to now , only 60 cases had been dealt with ; the remaining 116 operators are still haggling with the government . in the past two years , while having to take care of the day - to - day running of their business , the owners of these small enterprises also had to make arrangement for their removal and deal with the government 's complex compensation procedures . how can they have the energy to develop their business ? review the compensation system in his policy address , the chief executive put forth three themes in relation to helping the small and medium enterprises , and they are assistance offered " to start a new business , to build up a new business , and to promote a business " . with respect to the policy on land resumption , i feel that the theme on " assisting to build a new business " should be more specifically implemented . the government , therefore , should aim at helping the operators to resume their operations as the basis for calculating compensation . in handling compensation for wah kai industrial centre , the government 's proposal included an amount to cover the land interests as assessed with reference to the open market value , and an amount that covered two parts : an ex gratia payment for disturbance caused and the business loss , which is calculated according to a special rate . the point of providing disturbance compensation was to relieve the economic hardship that the operators suffered as a result of removing their businesses from the affected building . the ex gratia payment that each operator received was calculated at a rate of $2,190 per square metre of the actual floor area occupied . the government pointed out that this rate was applicable to all industrial buildings in hong kong that were affected by clearance , and that consideration had also been given to the costs of removal , rent of the new property during decoration , basic decoration cost and the intermediary costs in relation to the purchase of a new property . however , over half of the operators did not accept this method of compensation and went ahead with a claim . at the moment , in relation to compensation given to resuming private residential properties , the government will assist the owners to purchase similar - sized properties within the same district . if applied to the factory operators , this principle should have provided sufficient compensation to enable them to resume their operations . the government should therefore further review the calculation of ex gratia payment , which was updated last march , and consider giving the operators an ex gratia payment that is sufficient for them to resume their operations . establish an interim loan in relation to the current compensation for land resumption , the value of land interests is calculated with reference to the open market value . however , with the significant drop in property price in recent years , many operators that are forced to move immediately find themselves affected by the effect of negative equity in their assets . though , according to transaction records , most of the operators at wah kai bought their properties at a relatively low price some years ago , they mortgaged their properties to the banks for loans when the property prices were at their peak . if compensation were calculated with reference to the market value , the appraised value would be far lower than the loan value . the compensation that these operators obtained would thus be enough only to repay their bank loans and they would not have the capital to find another property for their factories . in fact , these small enterprises also experienced difficulties when applying for bank loans , as a bank must consider the condition of these operators ' business before providing them with a loan . given the current depressed state of our economy , many operators do not fare too well in their business and find it hard to obtain loans to keep their business afloat . once the government has to resume their land , even if compensation were given according to the market value , it would be impossible for them to stage a comeback in their business . the government must therefore formulate a plan as soon as possible so that , by providing interim loans , those affected owners or occupiers can be helped to regain their footing to continue with their operations . expedite the handling of claims under the existing mechanism , if operators affected by land resumption do not agree to the proposed compensation , they can lodge a claim with the lands department asking for an increase in the compensation or claiming disturbance compensation , provided they furnish all the necessary evidence . the department would then process each claim with reference to the arguments provided . if a claimant cannot reach an agreement with the department , the claimant may refer his claim to the lands tribunal for a final decision . the government issued its compensation proposal to the owners or occupiers of wah kai industrial centre in july 1999 , but up to now , in relation to compensation , only 8% of the owners have accepted the government 's proposal , with the rest still awaiting hearing by the lands tribunal . as to ex gratia payment , there are still 35% of the operators making their claims . the drawn - out claim procedure is very disruptive to the normal operations of the operators . when it is to acquire land , the government should increase its staff to process the operators ' claims as soon as possible . the procedure should also be more flexible . as some operators may not have a clear and systematic set of accounts , they may find it hard to obtain full compensation . with respect to some special cases , the government should aim at helping these operators to resume their operations and be more flexible in the processing of such cases . there is nothing we can complain strongly about if land is resumed for the construction of public facilities ; however , if we just let the affected factory operators close down or get so frustrated in the process , it would create much instability within our society . the government therefore should not drag its feet any more on a review of the compensation system . accordingly , i so submit . thank you , madam president . mr albert ho : madam president , what most of the members discussed just now was on how businesses were affected by the government 's land resumption . while we are discussing this motion , i would like to take this opportunity to discuss initially , under certain conditions , if the government has sufficient legal grounds to resume land , especially land in the new territories . i feel that this is an issue of extreme importance , as this is an issue that should be dealt with first before any discussion can be made about compensation , or what sort of compensation is reasonable . i would like to give a real - life example . in 1999 when the government announced that a smokeless environmental city was to be built at hung shui kiu , yuen long , a great deal of controversies began to crop up . the government planned to develop a new town of population 160000 at hung shui kiu , which would include low - density residences , parks , roads and a logistic base for containers . places affected by this development include many villages , like ping sun tsuen , tan kwai tsuen , yik yuen tsuen and tin sum tsuen , and a total of 2000 households or more than 5000 residents would be affected by the clearance . whether the development of this environmental city can achieve the purpose of environmental protection has in fact already been queried by many people ; and i also doubt if there is really appropriate legislation under which the government can effect the resumption of land . let us first not talk about the urban renewal authority ordinance , which is not applicable to rural areas , at the moment , when the government has to acquire private land for public use , the legislations that the government usually uses include lands resumption ordinance , roads ( works , use and compensation ) ordinance , railways ordinance and water pollution control ( sewerage ) regulation . if the government wants to carry out certain projects for public use , including the construction of roads , sewers , river management or even development of public housing , it would have to invoke the above legislation . however , for the environmental town at hung shui kiu , the government relies on town planning ordinance , using the procedure for town - planning to freeze the development of land . however , how land is to be resumed in the future , the government still refuses to disclose anything . in fact , from past cases , like at tsuen wan , the government had resumed land under the lands resumption ordinance , and one tenth of the land resumed was used for road construction , while private developers exchanged for the remaining nine tenths of the land under exchange entitlements for private development . i remember that the government had resumed land at lam tei with a small portion of it for sewerage use , while the majority of the land is used to rebuild the local residents ' village . so is this appropriate ? can the government use these legislations to rebuild the rural towns ? i have great doubts . even though the government would make compensation , that does not mean that it can resume whatever land it likes . i therefore hope that the government can give a clear reply on this . for urban areas , the government can resume land under the urban renewal authority ordinance to redevelop the old districts . however , for rural areas , is there a need for the government to pass a piece of legislation on rural land development so that it can resume land according certain procedure and plan , and make appropriate and reasonable compensation and relocation arrangement for the affected residents , including the farmers , businesses and residents ? how can the government , while considering that it is not necessary to have such legislations , resume whatever land it likes under the lands resumption ordinance and the roads ordinance ? this is my greatest concern . just now , a member pointed out that resuming agricultural land has also led to a lot of problems because the government gave no reasonable assistance and relocation arrangement . for example , when we hold discussion with the government officials over the agricultural land rehabilitation scheme , which is supposed to help the farmers , it was just like a farce as the plan would just be too difficult to implement . the farmers have to find a similar plot of land themselves , then the government would lease the land to them . there is little chance , i think , for the plan to be successful . after 1998 , one must pass a means test . as to the amount of compensation , it is way below the level that can be considered reasonable by those affected . for example , the affected residents would be compensated with only $128 per square metre of their living unit . as most of them are living in village houses or on land under a licence from the government , a sum of a hundred thousand dollars or so would not be of much help in finding another home ? for problems in the urban areas , mr albert chan and other colleagues have already stated very clearly . the government 's arrangement for industrial buildings is even ridiculous and unreasonable , making one doubt if those business operators , who sacrifice themselves for public interest , have been fairly treated by the government ? i feel that the government has short changed those affected by land resumption . i would like to point out one thing . we all know that after the passage of the urban renewal authority bill , the government has already provided better terms of compensation and been more generous to the business operators . however , why should the government find it hard to match the compensation criteria under the lands resumption ordinance with these terms ? why has it still behaved so haughtily to those affected in the wah kai incident , leaving many of the operators feeling bewildered as to when they can resume their operations ? many affected people expressed that their miseries were caused the government and felt helpless about their living . is this what a responsible government would do ? i therefore feel that the government has the responsibility to conduct a comprehensive review of our legislation on land resumption with reference to the legal basis as well as the whole compensation policy for land resumption . with these remarks , i support the motion . dr tang siu - tong : madam president , hong kong is a place which , though congested and densely populated , respects private property . if , for the purpose of works on infrastructure or public facilities , the government has to acquire land from private citizens , it should not be criticized , in fact , we should rally support behind it . however , as the final decision - maker on the compensation policy for land resumption , the government naturally will make it benefit the most from the policy , but the interests of many titleholders may have to suffer in varying degrees , causing some of the helpless titleholders resort to violence and clash with the police . the mass media , while racing for time and having limited space , may put greater emphasis on the clashes in their coverage . the resulting effect may not be objective and the actual causes of the clashes have also become blurred . the ordinary citizens would thus mistake the titleholders as people who would breed troubles in order to exhort a large compensation from the government . this would put these titleholders in a very disadvantaged position when they were to hold talks with the government . the hong kong progressive alliance ( hkpa ) thinks that in the process of acquiring land , the government must work hard to maintain a balance between the needs of public construction and those of the titleholders , instead of just waving the public interest flag and sacrificing the interests of a small group of titleholders . in fact , establishing a compensation mechanism that is fair and reasonable to the titleholders not only can help prevent the clashes like those at shek wu sun tsuen and wah kai industrial centre , where the conflict between the government and the citizens became protracted , it can also take care of the needs for social development and those of titleholders , making it faster and easier for the government to begin public works . the existing compensation policy is not fair to the titleholders . in fact , it is a catalyst for the clashes between the government and the citizens . the inadequacies of the policy are as follows : first , the government only focuses on the need for carrying out public works , thus it very often acquires a large portion of a plot of land , leaving the small portion hard to be put to any use by the titleholder ; second , the government tends to resume land in phases and does not make known the long - term resumption plan . such a practice of course allows the government to flexibly plan the development , but it also makes the titleholders not knowing what to do ; third , there were cases where the government acquired private land at a low price , subsequently changed its land use and sold it at a high price . this made the titleholders feel that they were being cheated . the tsuen wan case quoted by mr albert ho clearly reflects the actual situation ; and four , the existing compensation mechanism is basically based on the lands resumption ordinance and the railways ordinance , which two types of compensation : statutory compensation and ex gratia payment , however , these two types of payment can hardly be said to be fair and reasonable to the titleholders . statutory compensation is calculated on the basis of the market value ( that is , the premises shell price ) as on the day that the government 's resumption notice is gazetted . this calculation basis is particularly unfair to those titleholders whose property depreciated in value as a result of the financial crisis . on the other hand , besides the statutory compensation , the titleholders may also , by applying for an ex gratia payment , negotiate with the government for an additional , and without pre-set upper limit , compensation amount for the business and other losses . however , only a limited number of people can benefit from this . many titleholders ( especially those small owners ) , other than going to their lawyers to settle all matters relating to the deeds of their properties , have no knowledge of the need to engage surveyors to negotiate with the government on the amount of compensation , not to mention their having no idea that they have to first collect relevant information and other evidence to support their application . the hkpa thinks that the government can improve the compensation mechanism in the areas as follows : first , the government should disclose all information relating to land resumption , including the area covered , time and the future direction , so that the public and the professionals can have a better understanding of the rationale behind any resumption . second , when acquiring land in the past , the government often would negotiate with the titleholder on the area of land to be acquired , but now instead of making any prior contact , the government would publish the resumption proposal in the gazette . for those who know little about the gazettal procedure , they would miss the deadline for lodging an appeal in respect of compensation . the government should reinstate the old system by negotiating with the titleholders and assisting them to find another location for the continuation of their operations , and enable the titleholders to fully understand their rights and what appeal channels are open to them . third , at the moment , the government usually takes about half a year to give a reply to the valuation reports that are submitted by the titleholders in respect of their own properties . the reply usually would only give the value as appraised by the government , without any detail information , making it hard for the titleholders to assess whether or not the government 's valuation is objective and reasonable . if the titleholders ask the government to provide further details , that often would mean waiting for another half a year . in the face of such a cumbersome process , there is really a need for the government to simplify and expedite the valuation process and provide , in the first instance , the rationale behind the government 's valuation so that the titleholders can have a basis for them to engage agents to negotiate with the government on their behalf or submit their case to the lands tribunal for adjudication . fourth , when the government makes compensation payment , a lot of red tapes are often involved and the necessary documents are often not delivered on time , thus delaying the payment of compensation , causing the mobility of the operators to arrange resumption of business or to switch to other business as early as they can . the government should be responsible for assisting business operators affected by land resumption to resume their operations or switch to other business so as to maintain hong kong 's economic prosperity . as the government plans to begin a number of public works in the coming 10 years , it is inevitable that the government has to acquire a large amount of land from private owners , and it is also inevitable that the government has to negotiate compensation arrangement with the titleholders . the government must therefore formulate a compensation policy that is fair and reasonable , rendering the government , the public and the titleholders all winners in the process . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . mr ip kwok - him : madam president , in his 1999 policy address , the chief executive pointed out that the government would use more than $200 billion to begin a series of infrastructure projects , including a number of railways and roads , with a total length of 160km . the urban renewal authority is officially established and will , in the coming 20 years , carry out more than 200 redevelopment projects in the old districts . the government also plans to carry out large - scale town - planning projects on the reclaimed land in southeast kowloon and western kowloon , on both sides of the victoria harbour and at a number of other places . they are to provide a comfortable living environment for the millions of local residents , and a tourist spot with its own characteristics and attractions . i believe that hong kong will turn into a new face soon . i remember when the urban renewal authority bill was discussed , the various political parties of the legislative council and the government reached a consensus that we must stick to a " people - oriented " policy . to achieve this , besides providing a better living , working , recreational and entertainment environment , we must ensure that none of the parties involved would have to suffer any unnecessary loss as a result of the development . the democratic alliance for betterment of hong kong ( dab ) has repeatedly stressed this point on a number of occasions . regrettably , the government 's existing compensation arrangement is still far from satisfactory . the dab feels great regret over the clashes between the government and the residents over land resumption . madam president , as mr albert chan 's motion today focuses mainly on the compensation issue of non-residential property , i will therefore speak mainly on the compensation given to business operators . my colleagues have already talked about the compensation for industrial property . on the issue of compensation paid to residents , the dab 's position is known to all . under the existing arrangement , the government , when resuming land under certain legislation , would pay the owners of commercial properties a compensation that is equivalent to the market value of the properties on the day they are resumed , plus an additional compensation . if those affected could provide sufficient evidence , the government would compensate them for their lost business , otherwise the government would pay them an ex gratia payment , which includes one month 's rental , removal costs , decoration costs and other expenses . however , we can all see that a lot of disputes would arise in the course of handling such compensation . it is because very often those affected cannot furnish a certain data regarding their past operations , thus creating a lot of variables in the compensation process or rendering them unable to be compensated for what they have lost . madam president , in calculating the ex gratia payment , the government can be said to be very harsh in the past . there was even a greater difference between the government and the land development corporation ( ldc ) , which is now no longer in existence . records show that for a 50sqm street - level shop , which had a market value of $2 million , if the owners could not prove any business loss , the government would only pay a compensation of $2.13 million , and the ex gratia payment would only be 7% of the market value . the ex gratia payment paid by the ldc was 35% of the market value , which , after all the calculations , meant that the total compensation could be as much as $2.7 million . as to the compensation made to rental tenants , the difference between the two was even greater , because the ldc might pay a compensation as high as five times the ex gratia payment offered by the government . it is unacceptable that the same plot of land , when resumed by different agencies , could result in such a huge difference in compensation . it is no wonder that every time the government resumes land , it would lead to clashes between the government and the residents . last march , the government put forth a new compensation arrangement by raising the compensation level paid to the owners and tenants of commercial properties . according to the proposal , the owners may get back the open market value , plus four times the rateable value of the properties concerned as ex gratia payment . using the example above , those affected would receive a compensation of $600,000 , which is about 30% of the market value . the compensation that a tenant may obtain is three times the rateable value , which is about $440,000 . madam president , the dab always thinks that , in acquiring land for development , the government should , as regard the level of compensation made , not be lower than the ldc . the new proposal , or new arrangement , from the government , though already raising the compensation the owners can get , obviously is still worse than that provided by the ldc in the past . the dab therefore thinks that the new arrangement still needs to be improved . madam president , the dab supports mr albert chan 's motion . the government should , without delay , review the compensation policy for land resumption , rectify the situation whereby different agencies pay different rates of compensation , and try its best to help those affected to continue with their operations . with these remarks , i support the motion . miss choy so - yuk : madam president , with the burst of the bubble economy , the chief executive and a number of officials of the sar government stressed on a number of occasions the key effect of the small and medium enterprises ( smes ) to hong kong economy , and proposed plans in different forms , hoping that assistance could be given to the smes that were in deep troubles and putting hong kong economy on a firmer basis . ironically , the government 's compensation policy for land resumption has just gone against this . business operators affected by land resumption often found themselves forced to close down their business because the compensation given was so little that they could not find another location close by to resume their operations . these people have nowhere to let off their pent - up anger , and it is no wonder that the clashes between the government and these people that have dogged every land resumption plan are getting more and more fierce . the mismatch in policy not only damages our economic basis and undercuts our competitiveness , it also aggravates the conflict between the government and the business operators and intensifies social antagonism , creating a much worse scenario . madam president , as i have been assisting the factory operators in government factory buildings to negotiate their legitimate interests , i would therefore like to talk about the hardship these operators are facing and the unreasonableness of the existing compensation policy . factories in government factory buildings are mainly run as family businesses , which , in the sixties and seventies , helped set a firm foundation for hong kong 's economic development and had made major contributions to our economic takeoff in the seventies . though with the restructuring of hong kong economy , many of our local industries have moved northward , there are still quite a number of factory owners who , because of their own economic condition or some other reasons , have not moved their production lines into china ; rather , they elect to put up with it in hong kong . these small factories do not have much of an effect on hong kong 's current economy , for after all , in the eyes of the sar government , there are only rich businessmen and trans - national companies . the small businesses have no place in their eyes , not to mention obtaining any assistance from the government to enable them to rebuild hong kong 's economic foundation . however , while hong kong is undergoing economic restructuring , these small factories employ tens of thousands of senior grass - roots workers so that they do not have to rely on comprehensive social security assistance for their living . these small factories certainly have made their contributions . regrettably , the government has not only refused to assist and support them , but has on the issue of land resumption cared more about making money than the life and death of these operators . the government is doing the harshest and meanest it can , with the housing authority coming out as the meanest of them all . take cheung sha wan factory building as an example , the housing department suddenly announced a change in the land use of the original site , and turned it into land used for constructing commercial and residential buildings , thus making huge economic gain . however , the ex gratia payment offered to every factory was pitifully little , with the highest only a hundred thousand dollars or so . with this compensation , a factory operator would fail not only to find another place in the same district to resume operations , but he will also find that if he were to close down his business he would not have enough to pay even one employee 's severance pay . in fact , from the past records , the compensation level as paid by the housing department to factory operators at cheung sha wan factory building remains relatively the same over the past 10 years . can such a compensation policy that would kill off our only industrial basis be said to be supportive of smes ? now , besides the operators in cheung sha wan factory building , operators in other government factory buildings also have similar experience . the housing department often stresses that the rent at the above government factory buildings is already very low . this is only their one - sided view of the situation which is misleading . we have to note that the units that the operators first moved in did not have any facilities . not only did it have no electricity and water supply , a so - called factory unit , except for a few pillars , did not even have walls , doors or windows . before beginning the operation of their businesses , the operators had to fork out a large sum of money to install electricity cable and water pipes , build walls , doors and windows . all the basic facilities that a unit needs had to be taken care of by the operators themselves before they could begin their business . the facilities as provided by the factory buildings were minimal ; of course they could not be compared with the modern factory buildings , but some even did not have such basic facilities as passenger and delivery lifts . those on the top floors would have to push their goods up the long slope in a handcart every day . you can imagine the difficulties of transporting goods in and out of the factories . regrettably , the housing department cared nothing about the poor facilities at these factory buildings ; and turning a blind eye to the fact that for the past 10 years the rent at other factory buildings is falling , it just keeps on increasing the rent 25% every two years , causing the rent for some of the units to be as high as $6 to $10 per foot . this level of rent is such a heavy burden to the operators that they are moaning and groaning under it . madam president , all these cases show that despite all the work that the factory owners in these government factory buildings had put into the factory units , they were not getting the sort of respect and recognition that they deserved . now , when it comes to redevelopment for profit , the housing department shows no sincerity in negotiating with the factory owners about their compensation and insists on only a fixed rate for compensation . such a high - handed approach to resume the factory building has completely brushed aside the efforts that the operators have put into their units . of course , such an approach would not be acceptable to the operators and would deal a heavy blow to these operators who have all along been contributing much to this society . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . president : does any member wish to speak ? ( no member responded ) secretary for planning and lands : madam president , i am very grateful for the valuable advice which honourable members have put forward in relation to this motion . i think honourable members are well aware that the reason why land is resumed has nothing to do with causing distress and inconvenience to the public , but that land is resumed in the interests of the public . we are making a review of the compensation policy on land resumption and the procedures for land resumption . at the same time , we are studying into how assistance can be given to operators affected by the resumption and how they can continue with their business . therefore , the motion debate is a timely one . many honourable members have mentioned in their speeches many details on compensation arrangements and i do not want to repeat them here . however , before replying to the questions raised by honourable members , i would like to explain briefly the concepts behind the current compensation arrangements on land resumption . i would like to explain the major types of compensation briefly . the first kind is statutory compensation . at present , owners whose property or land is affected by resumption are entitled to a sum of statutory compensation . under the lands resumption ordinance , statutory compensation includes the open market value of the property or land being resumed and the statutory right to make a claim for disturbance payment . first of all , the open market value of the property or land being resumed refers to the reasonably expected transaction price when the owner sells the property concerned in the open market out of his own free will . in addition , operators affected by the resumption , including owners using the land for their own use or the tenants , are all entitled to making a claim for disturbance payment . disturbance payment covers compensation for loss of business , removal expenses and service fees charged by professionals . claims must be substantiated by written proofs . another major type of allowance is known as ex gratia allowance . in order to provide proofs to substantiate their claims for disturbance payment , operators of commercial , industrial and agricultural undertakings often have to spend a lot of time and efforts . in some cases , the affected operators find it hard to produce sufficient written proofs to show that their business has been affected . this point has been mentioned by some honourable members earlier . in view of this , the government will pay out an ex gratia allowance to owners using their property for their own use and the tenants concerned . under such an arrangement , the affected operators may choose to receive the ex gratia allowance as part of the statutory claim they are entitled to or as all of the compensation claim . in the latter case , the amount will be deemed as the final compensation . as for compensation with respect to commercial premises , we have made a review of the ex gratia allowance paid out to owners or tenants of commercial premises affected by resumption . under the new policy passed on 30 march this year by the finance committee of the legislative council , the amount of ex gratia compensation payable to owners and tenants of commercial premises will be four times and three times respectively of the ratable value of the premises resumed . owners of leased or vacant flats will receive an ex gratia allowance equal to the ratable value of the property resumed . as for industrial property , the review i have mentioned which was made in march this year did not include the ex gratia allowance paid to those owners of industrial premises and factories or their tenants affected by resumption . however , we have pledged to make a speedy review of this allowance . currently , the ex gratia allowance paid out to owners and tenants of industrial premises and factories is calculated according to a formula . the formula includes items such as rental payable during the period of renovation , removal expenses , basic renovation fees , stamp duty , solicitor fees and estate agent 's fees and so on . we are of the view that the current formula for ex gratia allowance should be reviewed and adjusted to suit the needs of the times . presently we are making a review of this and we hope to submit recommendations to honourable members within a short time . as for the number of issues and recommendations raised by honourable members earlier , i would like to make a brief response here . in this motion debate , some honourable members urged the administration to make a review of the compensation policy on land resumption . i have mentioned earlier that we have begun work in this aspect . also , as i have mentioned , we have completed a review of the ex gratia allowance payable to owners and tenants of commercial premises this march and the findings have been submitted to the finance committee for deliberation . we hope to finish the review of the ex gratia allowance payable to owners and tenants of industrial premises and factories in the near future . when the review is finished , we will consult the relevant panel of the legislative council . in addition , some honourable members urged the administration to make a review of the relevant administrative arrangements of the payment of ex gratia allowances . we are conducting a review of the issue . we hope that by simplifying the application procedures for disturbance payment and speeding up the compensation for land resumption , we can offer assistance to those operators affected by land resumption so that they can continue with their operations . as to the question of the ex gratia allowance paid to those owners and tenants of industrial and commercial premises being insufficient to help them find another location to resume their business , some honourable members have suggested earlier that a loan scheme should be set up to provide some interim relief loan to those affected . we are in favour of this approach and we are presently studying into the possibility of setting up a loan scheme for the operators of small and medium enterprises affected . i hope work in this respect can be completed by the end of this year . in sum , both the administration and the honourable members are very much concerned about the hardship faced by operators affected by land resumption . we will conduct a review of the compensation policy and procedures on land resumption with a view to simplifying the process and shortening the time taken , hence helping those affected to continue with their business . i would like to take this opportunity to thank honourable members again for the valuable advice which they have given , especially for the people - oriented approach which they have raised , and the proposal to strike a balance between the requests of those affected and the need to spend public money sensibly , as well as pursuing the interests of the public . my colleagues and i will consider the proposals raised by honourable members and we will look into the feasibility of each of the proposals before submitting our recommendations to the legislative council for deliberation . thank you , madam president . president : mr albert chan , you may give your reply , and you have one minute 30 seconds . mr albert chan : madam president , many thanks to the 12 members who have spoken and supported this motion . as it is very hard to arrive at a consensus in the legislative council nowadays , it is certainly a miracle for my motion to have garnered such strong consensus . madam president , this miracle in fact reflects an objective fact , and shows that the problem which has been in existence generally is pretty serious , otherwise it would not be possible for mr lau wong - fat , who is known for his real estate background in the new territories , and many other regional members to express similar experiences and opinion in relation to the problems of land resumption that many small factories or family factories are facing . in other words , there exists much unfairness , unreasonableness and even dubious legal basis when the government goes about with its land resumption programme . i hope that the government can really conduct a review and come up with some reasonable proposals and decision . many trades and industries are now facing extinction . simply put , by 2011 , the log pond at yam o will be completely resumed by the government . many of the rare industries in the new territories will also become extinct soon . if the government is willing to protect rare species , i hope that it will also help these industries . i hope that i can receive some good news from the government later . thank you , madam president . i also wish to thank all members for their support . president : i now put the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by mr albert chan be passed . will those in favour please raise their hands ? ( members raised their hands ) president : those against please raise their hands . ( no hands raised ) president : i think that the motion is agreed by a majority of the members present . i declare the motion passed . president : second motion : expeditiously improving flood prevention and relief work . expeditiously improving flood prevention and relief work dr tang siu - tong : madam president , i move the motion standing in my name as printed on the agenda . with regard to the flooding problem in north west new territories , i , as early as the time of reunification , in this council asked the government to speed up the progress of flood prevention works . however , after four years since the passage of the motion , the work done by the government in implementing and monitoring the progress of major flood prevention projects in the new territories has been disappointing . what is more , there have been cases in which flooding got worse during rainstorms because of the flood prevention works itself . hence , i again move a motion today calling upon the authorities to make due response to this council 's request to expeditiously improve flood prevention and relief work . i am going to explain in detail the wording of the motion . madam president , with various major flood prevention works in the new territories scheduled to start or be completed within the past two years , these two years should have been worth celebrating . paradoxically , over the past two years , there have been floods often attributable to the piling up of sand , mud and construction materials as a result of poor regulation of sites where flood prevention works are carried out and even to the blockage of drainage channels consequent upon the collapse of make - shift iron bridges . last year , in its report on the flooding that occurred on 14 april 2000 , the works bureau ( wb ) pointed out that contractors of the territory development department ( tdd ) had built temporary earth bunds within the area of the tin shui wai main drainage channel , thus raised the water level in the channel and consequently caused flooding . how about this year ? there has been no improvement in the situation , which has in fact taken a turn for the worse . in places like san tin , chuk yuen and yau tam mei in yuen long , sand and mud from tdd work sites blocked up drainage channels , and the discharge of flood water was obstructed by make - shift iron bridges . as a result , the whole area of san tin was turned into a flood plain . at tsat sing kong , kam tin , there was even a case where a drainage channel was being blocked by the collapse of a temporary road bridge . similar situations prevailed at the work sites along river indus in sheung shui . with their sand and mud not properly covered as required by regulations , earth mounds earmarked for the construction of river banks were washed away by heavy rain , causing blockage to make - shift drainage channels and thus aggravating the flooding along the river . recurrence of such incidents is indicative of the government 's remissness in monitoring work sites ! the government ought to learn a lesson from such bitter mistakes , and take remedial measures , which should include more vigilant visits to work sites before the approach of heavy rain to ensure that contractors do implement flood prevention measures in accordance with contract terms . in addition , there ought to be strict stipulation requiring contractors to make arrangements well in advance so as to be able to deploy enough staff to man work sites at times of heavy rain in order to deal with emergency . for flood prevention works to cause flooding is too ridiculous . if it is allowed to occur again and again , it will only arouse people 's wrath . madam president , the drainage services department ( dsd ) , when reporting on the flooding incidents last month , stated that the various major flood prevention projects can only be completed one after another beyond 2003 . in this connection , madam president , please let me quote from the paper , " widespread flooding in the new territories is , regrettably , not unexpected " . however , on referring back to the information presented to this council by the wb , it can be noted with " regret " that the government has all along been causing delays to flood prevention works ! according to the information , of the 18 major new territories flood prevention projects on which the wb reported to this council in 1998 , half of the lot already experienced delays by the year 2000 , the worst being a delay of two and half years ! in 1997 , in response to my motion , the then secretary for planning , environment and lands vehemently stated that the flood prevention works at sha po tsuen in kam tin could be completed by the end of 1998 . however , last year , that is to say , in the year 2000 , that place was again turned into " an ocean of water . " probably because of poor performance by the contractor for works on river indus , the secretary for works eventually might blame the contractor for the delay . but who is responsible for monitoring project progress ? whose duty is it to regularly check contractors ' financial standing and to ensure the smooth progress of works ? government departments responsible for monitoring just cannot pass the buck in the event of delays in works due to contractors ' problems in those areas . other project delays not attributable to contractors ' performance total seven items , all in north west new territories . the government habitually puts up excuses such as the time - consuming nature of land resumption consultation , objection from landlords , or opposition to the works from residents and shop - operators , saying that it is hard to resume land ! has the administration reviewed its long - used policies on land resumption , compensation and rehousing , which have already become unreasonable and rigid ? on this , a lot of valuable opinions have been put forward by many members in our motion debate earlier on . the government should look into them . has the government considered adding flexibility to the rehousing arrangements relating to land resumption so as to avoid the recurrence of " the shek wu san tsuen incident of confrontation between government officers and the people " in november 1999 ? has consideration been given to the fact that residents giving up property rights to give way to flood prevention works ought to be given more compensation than those in the case of land resumption for ordinary development ? can the government , for the sake of society 's overall interests , increase the compensation for property owners ? has consideration been given to deploying additional resources , as far as possible , to build drains by means of the less disturbing trenchless techniques so as to win support from residents and shop - operators ? is it not true that earlier on the government , on realizing that urban redevelopment was a matter brooking no further delay , resolutely put forward brand new compensation and rehousing schemes ? why cannot the government make a little breakthrough in flood prevention - related land resumption and rehousing ? being confronted with problems such as difficulty of getting works started , slow progress and delays in completion , can the government only complain that " it is hard to resume land " , or put all the blame on the contractors ? it is hoped that the secretary for works can offer some new answers in delivering his reply later . madam president , in addition to the management and progress of flood prevention works , floods in the new territories also have much to do with the district 's persistent over - development and the extensive existence of inappropriate and unauthorized developments . the original natural drainage system in the district once functioned very well . however , for the development of housing projects or infrastructure , a lot of farmland was levelled up to form higher sites . to make room for outdoor container storage areas and workshops , rivers and streams were filled up . the natural drainage system has been severely debilitated or even ruined . furthermore , as a result of extensive developments , some rural areas are being surrounded by developed areas on higher ground formed by filling , thus becoming areas of man - made lowland . so , whenever it rains , there come floods . regarding these causes of flooding , the ones stemming from both lawful and unlawful developments , some have to be solved by flood prevention projects . however , scattered around the district and obstructing the discharge of flood water are many " environmental blackspots " . it is necessary for the authorities to expedite their clean - up . unfortunately , because of lack of co-operation from site operators , the progress of the clean - up of blackspots in recent years has been affected and insitu remedial works have slowed down . moreover , under the current town planning ordinance , penalty for unauthorized development is too lenient , thus rendering the law 's deterrent effect inadequate . the government should try to improve such a state of affairs and reduce the evil sequel of flooding . madam president , because of geographical and climatic factors , rainstorms can hit hong kong speedily , with uneven distribution . very often some places can record 10 mm of rainfall within five minutes . it is , therefore , necessary for flood warning and contingent works to be efficient . at present , the administration already has a set of system to cope with flooding . it is , however , apparently not good enough in dealing with the above emergency . for instance , currently not all places highly prone to flooding or those flooding blackspots are equipped with " flood warning system " . it is possible that while some places only merit the amber rainstorm warning , the rainfall in certain areas has already reached the level of the black rainstorm warning . many residents are just unable to get timely warning . furthermore , given the immensity of the new territories districts , the dsd just has not got enough contingency teams to meet the demand when there are drainage complaints coming from different areas at the same time . in the event of a breakdown of pumps or a blockage of channels by landslides , the dsd work teams , under - staffed and ill - equipped in terms of technology and tools , will be very much at their wit 's end even when they are notified . last month 's flood in pok wai , san tin , is an example . at that time , the emergency hotline provided by the contractor was not manned . though contact with the dsd was established after several hours ' hard efforts , the officers concerned did not know how to operate the contractor 's pump . so , time just slipped by as it was necessary to wait until the contractor 's site workers arrived to start the pump to pump away the water . as a result , relief work was delayed . it is , therefore , necessary for the newly - formed inter - departmental task force to conduct a review to see if the existing system can adequately handle emergencies . madam president , with regard to the wording of the motion , i wish to speak on one final point . as the flooding of last month involved both the dsd and tdd , and has something to do with their performance in monitoring works , i think that for the sake of fairness it is necessary to conduct an independent investigation so as to identify the responsibilities of all parties , including the dsd and tdd . furthermore , flood victims do not have site information . it is also difficult for them to get assistance from experts for the determination of causes of the flooding . they , therefore , face a lot of difficulties in pursuing their compensation claims . i am of the opinion that on completing the investigation , the flooding investigation team is obligated to assist the affected residents in claiming reasonable compensation from the parties concerned . madam president , i so submit . dr tang siu - tong moved the following motion : ( translation ) " that , as the government has failed to effectively monitor the implementation and progress of flood prevention works , resulting in residents in various districts of hong kong ( especially the north and north west new territories ) suffering losses due to serious flooding , this council requests the government to expeditiously improve flood prevention and relief work , including : ( a ) closely monitoring the implementation of various flood prevention projects , which include preventing the blockage of drainage channels by mud and gravel from work sites , temporary facilities , construction materials and machinery , etc ; ( b ) improving the existing mechanisms for land resumption , compensation and rehousing , and allocating additional resources to speed up the flood prevention projects while , at the same time , adopting measures to safeguard against delays of such projects due to the shortage of funds and inadequate technology on the part of the contractors ; ( c ) thoroughly investigating the causes of recurrent flooding in various areas over the years , and formulating a comprehensive contingency plan covering flood forecasting , flood prevention and relief work ; ( d ) identifying the responsibilities of the parties concerned for the recent occurrence of widespread flooding , and assisting the affected residents in seeking reasonable compensation ; and ( e ) expeditiously cleaning up the environmental blackspots which affect the flood prevention projects in the new territories , and stepping up maintenance and clearance works on drainage systems before the approach of the rainy season . " president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by dr tang siu - tong be passed . president : mr wong sing - chi will move an amendment to this motion , as printed on the agenda . in accordance with the rules of procedure , the motion and the amendment will now be debated together in a joint debate . i now call upon mr wong sing - chi to speak and move his amendment . mr wong sing - chi : i move that dr tang siu - tong 's motion be amended , as printed on the agenda . madam president , today i move an amendment to the motion of " expeditiously improving flood prevention and relief work " because i want to express the disapproval and disappointment felt by myself and the democratic party regarding the scanty attention the government paid to the flooding problem over the years and the way in which the problem is being handled . it is our hope that the government would not again and again frivolously blame the flooding on natural factors such as the amount of rainfall and the low - lying terrain while neglecting flood prevention work and allowing the departments and individuals suspected of dereliction of duties to slip away or pass the buck . at the same time , i want to propose to the government via the present amendment that pragmatic assistance be given to those living in badly flooded areas , and arrangements be made for eligible villagers to be allocated with public housing flats . it is hoped that we can all see that a few officials going to the districts to offer consolation or the chief executive reading the map cannot solve the flooding problem at all . as a matter of fact , the government is actually " putting the blame on heavy rain while being negligent in flood prevention , and pretending to be concerned while being incompetent in helping the victims " . we are now discussing the flooding problem . it is likely for the flooding problem to strike again this evening . today , fellow members might be saying that the government is not doing things properly . let us wait until tonight to see what government officials will do to deal with the forthcoming serious flood . according to a survey conducted by the democratic party a week ago , 65% of those polled consider flooding in hong kong to be serious . some 70% of the people think that the flooding affecting many districts in hong kong in early june had something to do with human errors and that the government should be held responsible for that . the survey reflects the seriousness of the flooding problem and underscores the government 's persistent negligence and remissness over the years . ever since the major flood that hit the north district in 1993 , it has been a routine for places near river indus and river beas to have several major floods every year during the rainy season . still fresh in our minds are the scenes of 26 september 1993 , when firemen and policemen mobilized helicopters and rubber boats to rescue flood victims . we were then informed by the royal observatory that it was a downpour which only occurred once in 50 years . furthermore , no improvement works had ever been done to the river courses , and shenzhen was also discharging flood water . all these brought 7 ft or 8 ft of water to several flooded areas in the north district . however , by the time of the flooding in june this year , the repairing and improvement works of river indus were already close to completion . the hong kong observatory told us that the downpour in early june was one that occurred once a decade . and on that occasion there was no discharge of flood water from the shenzhen reservoir . however , on that day , the water was 8 ft or 10 ft deep . it took 10 hours or even longer for the water to recede . we were also informed by the territory development department ( tdd ) and the drainage services department ( dsd ) that some 200cum of sand and mud , according to estimate , got swept into the river course as debris had been accumulated on both sides of the river course . surely the government does not think that the debris accumulated on both sides of the river course is the chief culprit responsible for the flooding problem . however , we apparently do not believe that flooding has nothing to do with the debris . even after tsat sing kong bridge in yuen long gave way to torrents , the government told us that the water had not washed away any sand , something that wind can blow away . what a lie ! the downpour of last wednesday again turned north west new territories into a flood plain . it has come to the notice of some villagers that sand and mud accumulated beside river indus still remains uncovered with protective canvas sheets . according to the government , contractors will be asked to do so as soon as possible . as sand and mud keep dropping into the river , its water level may rise at a quicker speed . what is more , the flooding last time in the north district was equally severe because of the discharge of flood water from shenzhen river . in the final analysis , we can see that the problem stems from two factors : first , the slow dispersal of water in the river due to delays in contractors ' works , and second , contractors being under no actual government monitoring . the government has not evaluated the gravity of the hazard ; nor has it strictly required contractors to use canvas covers ; nor has it been able to address the situation of contractors delaying works . because of the contractor 's miscalculation of the depth of the rock stratum below river indus and the inadequacy of the human and material resources deployed , works originally scheduled for completion this september or next year have to be extended beyond the original date by half a year . in fact , the project at river indus is not unique in this respect . certain individual projects , such as the village flood prevention projects at yuen long 's shui pin tsuen and tai kui , can not be completed until 2005 . in the wake of the last flood , i personally visited the work site of river indus . it has come to my notice that nobody has been working there over the past few days . only a few workers were seen moving the debris away . up to this day , the government still stresses that the task force chaired by the secretary for works will ensure that flood prevention works will be completed as scheduled , and that all government departments have been asked to step up efforts in monitoring the progress of works . however , if contractors are short of funds , then they may even be " unable to make their way to the end . " the government is now at a loss as to what to do and is totally helpless . there is likely to be legal difficulty for the cancellation of contract . even if a contractor does relinquish the job and asks for permission to quit , the government still will have to invite tenders afresh . the tendering period will have to last at least eight months . furthermore , it is necessary to wait until the contractor has cleared the site . so , it is possible for the works to remain unfinished even after a lapse of two or three years . the government is so " toothless " that i really do not know what the government should do to address the situation now . obviously , the government had made some mistakes in dealing with these works . i , therefore , have to sound my condemnation . according to government definition , a district of serious flooding or a badly flooded district denotes a district with a flooded area measuring over 100 hectares , or one socially or economically suffering seriously from flooding . according to a report from the dsd this april , hong kong has seven blackspots where flooding is on a serious level . they include tin ping shan village , shek wu san tsuen , yau tam mei tsuen , and lam tsuen valley basin in the north district of the new territories . as a matter of fact , for eight years or even longer the north district in the new territories has been affected by flooding . whenever it rains , many villagers suddenly find a swimming pool in their homes and they are not the only objects that swim in it , for their refrigerators , television sets , vcd players and even furniture also float around them . i have been in touch with many villagers . in fact , many of them are unwilling to give up their homes for public housing units . in the first place , they do not want to pay rent . in the second place , they will have to take the trouble to move . basically , they do not want to leave . however , the flooding problem will be around for several years . torrents can instantly destroy their homes , and pose imminent danger to human lives . under such circumstances , how can they afford not to move away ? in order that they can get permanent and safe residences , we urge the government to relocate these people to public housing units as soon as possible , people who are living at places already deep under water but not yet on fire . coming to the last point . it can be noticed that with regard to stepping up regulatory control over land use , the government still leaves much to be desired . many villagers or landlords have raised the level of their land by filling . it seems that the government finds it hard to take prosecution actions . i call upon the government to review this . the government should actively take prosecution actions to stamp out the problem if it is found that the flooding of a district has been aggravated by landlords , farmers or any persons who have the level of their land raised by filling . madam president , it is hoped that the government can indeed discharge its due responsibilities so that people in districts affected by flooding can get on with their lives happily . i so submit . thank you , madam president . mr wong sing - chi moved the following amendment : ( translation ) " to add " strongly condemns the government for turning a blind eye to flooding problems over the years , and " after " this council " ; to add " expeditiously rehousing eligible residents of seriously flooded areas in public housing , " after " ( b ) improving the existing mechanisms for land resumption , compensation and rehousing , " ; to delete " and " after " and assisting the affected residents in seeking reasonable compensation ; " ; and to add " ; and ( f ) stepping up regulatory control over land use , and prosecuting cases of unauthorized developments so as to stamp out such developments " after " and stepping up maintenance and clearance works on drainage systems before the approach of the rainy season " . " president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the amendment , moved by mr wong sing - chi to dr tang siu - tong 's motion , be passed . mr tam yiu - chung : madam president , as a result of successive downpours in early june , different parts of hong kong , especially the rural areas in north and north west new territories were badly flooded . we can tell from scenes appearing on television and newspapers that those villagers are seriously threatened by torrential water and suffer tremendous property losses . their situation is indeed pitiable . after the rainstorm , i went to yau tam mei tsuen in yuen long and tai kong po tsuen in kam tin to visit flood victims together with some village representatives in a bid to understand their situation after the floods . what i saw was like this : large stretches of vegetable fields were damaged in the floods ; fish ponds gave way to torrents , resulting in most of the fishes and fries being washed away ; with roads and bridges commonly used by villagers ruined or damaged by torrents , villagers experienced great inconvenience and danger getting in and out ; people found most of their furniture and utensils either washed away or hopelessly water - damaged ; vivid on the walls were stains left behind by waist - deep water of that day . it is evident that huge damage has been done to these villages by the floods on that day . according to the villagers , the flooding on that occasion was , of course , mainly due to the heavy rainfall . however , they also complained that on the day of the flooding , the speed at which flood water subsided was very slow . they suspected that the drainage channel works between ngau tam mei and yau tam mei tsuen currently undertaken by the drainage services department and the tai kong po tsuen section of the training works of kam tin river were the " accomplices " responsible for the flood . the reason is that the villagers told me that this flood was one unprecedented in all the decades during which they lived there . once the projects got started , their houses and properties got into trouble right away . according to what i saw at the flood scene , there was a very " droopy " make - shift bridge . when the water level of the river rose , it was difficult for the water to drain away quickly . i also noticed the new river courses under construction on both sides of the bridge . as the project has yet to be completed , the two sides are not connected . so a detour has to be made to divert water from the original river course . as an alternative , facilities to drain away river water under normal circumstances are installed at the outlet of the original river course . the villagers blamed all these for obstructing the draining away of flood water . whether or not these were the causes and whether or not the blockage was due to silt dug up in the course of work being washed away by torrents because it had not been properly covered are accusations pending investigation and explanation by the departments concerned . if the conclusion of the investigation is that there are human errors , then the parties concerned will have to be held responsible . there are downpours every year and there are floods year in year out . i think that the government is determined to solve this problem , which has caused tremendous sufferings to the villagers . some flood prevention works in north west new territories were started in 1999 . what we want to know is whether the responsible government departments and contractors had taken any contingency measures while working on the projects in preparation for heavy rain so as to be able to effectively drain away torrential water in the river . it is hoped that government departments in charge of the projects can be mindful of factors that may affect the environment in the course of the works . finally , i wish to reflect the problems concerning the mechanism for compensation . among those flood victims whom i visited on that occasion were some fish farmers raising ornamental fish . they are mainly engaged in the breeding of koi , gold fish , and so on . as a result of the flood , they , like fish farmers raising food fish , lost a lot of ornamental fish and fish fries . however , when they approached the agriculture , fisheries and conservation department ( afcd ) for help , they were not given ex gratia allowance . they very much worried about their livelihood in the days to come . after my visits , i respectively informed the works bureau , the environment and food bureau and the home affairs department of the situation . later , the afcd did give ex gratia allowance to those ornamental fish farmers . i hope that this is not just a measure for once . the government should officially include ornamental fish farmers as eligible for assistance . madam president , typhoon utor today is going to hit hong kong directly . some people say that it may be necessary to hoist even higher typhoon warning signals this evening . i hope that the above situation would not occur again . it is also hoped that the government departments concerned can sum up their experience , get prevention work done properly , and comprehensively review both the measures adopted in the course of the works and follow - up actions so as to make improvement and do good to the villagers . with these remarks , i support the original motion . mr lau wong - fat : madam president , in the ancient history of our country , " dayu thrice travelled past his home without going in whilst combating floods . " to refer to this touching anecdote today indeed stirs up one 's feelings . just imagine dayu , way back in those ancient days , leading his men and using primitive tools , bravely combated against huge river torrents . the difficulty and immensity of the project are not measurable . to travel past his home thrice without going in simply amplifies the virtues of this great flood - combatant , namely , being a person showing concern for public interests above other things out of a wish to deliver people from grave hardship , and being totally selfless . now , after a lapse of several thousand years , floods still occur in a tiny place like hong kong . what is more , this flooding problem has been around for some 10 years , its gravity getting worse and worse year after year . this is something unheard - of from every angle and by every standard . to our legislature , this flooding problem is a topic that sounds stale . it can be recalled that ever since 1987 there were already a few motion debates on this matter by this council and its predecessor , let alone the many questions raised . facts show that all the comments and suggestions from legislators , and all the explanations and promises from government officials are , more or less , just futile . we still have to live with the flooding problem . there is a cantonese common saying that goes like this : " dried shrimp falling into water - it still could not make it even on reaching the bottom " . madam president , i am of the view that if this is indeed a responsible government , then it should come up with an honest explanation . flooding can be just as disastrous as the avian flu . it is sheer luck amidst such calamities that so far there have been no serious casualties . however , there is no guarantee that lady luck will always favour us . is it true that the authorities would not take the matter seriously , not until many people get drowned ? hong kong is so tiny a place . those so - called rivers are diminutive in terms of length and width . however , the authorities have gone so far as to say that the river training works is required to be done by three stages , one for the upper stream , one for the mid stream and one for the lower stream . so there comes a 10 - year plan . those not knowing the facts might think that we are dealing with major flood prevention projects similar to those for the yangtze river or the yellow river ! in short , the fact that the flooding problem remains unsolved even though it has been bothering us for years is indicative of the failure on the part of the authorities concerned to pay due attention to the issue . it is ridiculous for the flooding problem to get worse and worse because of repeated blockage of drainage channels by flood prevention works underway . this only serves to prove time after time that the authorities concerned are inadequate in monitoring , ineffective in discharge of duties , and void of crisis awareness . madam president , hong kong is a world-class financial centre as well as a cosmopolitan city . being endowed with very rich financial reserves and being so small in area , yet served by a civil service renowned for its quality and efficiency , its combat with floods is surprisingly too long drawn out and has turned out to be a big mess . this is really a big laughing stock as well as a total disgrace . but this is also a great tragedy for those badly hit by floods whenever it rains heavily . according to a sad account given by one of the victims of last month 's big flood , over the past 10 years he has replaced his refrigerator six times , but never dare to get a new one . will those in charge of the authorities blush on hearing these words , which embody much misery , helplessness , sorrow and anger ? madam president , i am already tired of speaking on this topic here in this chamber . perhaps it is time for our ombudsman to initiate investigation to see what is wrong with the authorities . nevertheless , with the state of affairs like that now , it is high time any government acted resolutely and urgently in a manner befitting a crisis situation , and gave top priority to the allocation of resources required in order to press on and complete river training works at top speed , so as to deliver from hardship as soon as possible those people living in flood - affected areas . if the authorities concerned remain absolutely unrepentant and just try to pass the buck around , then it is likely for them to end up in a situation where they will find it too late to regret and that they must face serious consequences . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . mr hui cheung - ching : madam president , it seems that once the annual rainy season sets in , flooding in north west new territories invariably will hit the news . in fact , the government has been carrying out flood prevention works for nearly 15 years . initially in the year 1987 , the civil engineering department was assigned to co-ordinate and alleviate the flooding problem . in 1989 , the drainage services department ( dsd ) was set up , and was given the full responsibility to oversee drainage works . however , over the last 10 years , other than some strategic studies of flood prevention and drainage works , only two substantial flood prevention projects have been launched , namely , the training works for shenzhen river launched in 1995 in conjunction with the shenzhen authorities , and the flood prevention works launched in 1996 for several villages in san tin and chau tau tsuen in the north west new territories . ever since 1997 the chief executive has again and again stressed in his policy addresses that it is necessary to solve the flooding problem affecting low - lying areas . some places , such as sham shui po and mong kok in west kowloon , have made marked improvement . it , however , appears that the departments concerned have yet to actively carry out various flood prevention projects in north west new territories . for instance , of the 18 items of flood prevention works proposed in 1998 for north and north west new territories , nine experience delays ranging from two months to more than two years . of these , eight items of works that concern blackspots of flooding in yuen long , kam tin and ngau tam mei have yet to get started . had it been able to complete the rural drainage rehabilitation scheme in respect of river indus early this year as scheduled , instead of having it delayed until this september , then river indus would not have been a major disaster site in the flood this time . with projects losing , not gaining , speed , it is going to take another 10 years before the whole system of flood prevention works can be completed . the damage and inconvenience to be caused to the residents during the rainy seasons of these years are immeasurable ! in the middle of last month , at a special meeting of the panel on planning , lands and works of this council , the dsd mentioned in relevant papers that the widespread flooding in north and north west new territories on this occasion " is not unexpected . " if the authorities can indeed predict like a prophet , why cannot it , with so many years of experience in the selection of flood prevention works contractors , foresee possible delays of such projects due to the shortage of funds or inadequate technology on the part of contractors ? furthermore , the district development and environmental improvement committee of the north district did ask the territory development department ( tdd ) to see to it that the contractors removed the debris from their work sites , or at least covered the debris with plastic sheets . how come there were still huge piles of debris when the floods came ? judging from the information available , contractors are , of course , the chief culprits responsible for the delays of flood prevention works . but how come the contractors can simply ignore those unfavourable inspection reports repeatedly issued by the government and the projects are allowed to drag on ? according to the explanation given by the government in defence , it is not advisable to terminate those delayed projects as it is going to require extra time if tenders are to be invited afresh , which may turn out to be even more time - consuming . however , the authorities just criticizes the contractors without taking actual actions to make them speed up the progress of works . is that not even more time - consuming ? why did the authorities , already expecting extensive flooding well in advance , not arrange co-ordination among different departments beforehand to have flood forecasting and prevention measures ready in hand ? this is equally disappointing . how come there were risky scenes in which children in the flooded area were being lifted up to helicopter from rooftops ? because of all these , the authorities must , in the first place , carefully review land use planning in respect of different parts of the new territories in order to avoid causing blockage to drains and step up monitoring so as to stamp out unlawful land uses . this includes preventing the blockage of drainage channels by mud and gravel from work sites , temporary facilities , construction materials and machinery ; speeding up the clean - up of environmental blackspots which affect the flood prevention projects in the new territories ; and stepping up maintenance and clearance works on drainage systems before the approach of the rainy season . at the same time , for the purpose of enhancing monitoring , there should be a review of the selection criteria of flood prevention works contractors and a requirement that contractors should submit more financial information at the time of tendering and in the course of the works . besides implementing flood prevention projects , the government should also make good use of the method of flood storage so as to be more effective in dealing with intensive and lingering rain . in singapore , the government collects rain water in flood storage tanks , and uses it for irrigation and street - washing on a routine basis . in hong kong , filtered water is being used for street - washing and irrigation . on comparison , the former is more economical . madam president , i so submit . prof ng ching - fai : madam president , the flooding problem in the new territories has been around for more than 10 years . even members have been discussing it for 10 years . all along the government has been offering some specious explanations , which include excuses such as technical problems , the act of god , remissness on the part of contractors , and the failure of the former urban council or the food and environmental hygiene department to clear away plastic bags and garbage . from a technical point of view , flooding in the north and north west new territories can definitely be surmounted . the key lies in having the determination and putting in efforts to work faster . according to some friends in the engineering sector , the slow progress of work by the planning department in the flood prevention project of river indus is primarily attributable to several factors , such as the environmental impact assessment ordinance , land resumption and " the lowest bidder wins " guideline for the selection of contractors . originally , new territories drainage projects are designed to improve the environment so as to free the residents from the threat of floods . if those projects are indeed delayed by the environmental impact assessment ordinance , then the whole thing is quite an irony . we should indeed reflect upon it . is there really something wrong with the current procedures for environmental impact assessment ( eia ) ? should there be a review ? we have got to ensure that while the eia requirements are being met , no delay is being caused to the projects . the slow progress of land resumption not only has something to do with land resumption compensation . is there adequate liaison between the lands department and the territory development department ? the efficiency of the departments concerned is also something that we should not turn a blind eye to . to sum up , in hong kong today , major government projects often take a lot of time to complete . it is especially so when compared with cities like singapore , guangzhou and shanghai . we should take a serious look at such a phenomenon as its continuation is going to be very unfavourable to our public administration , people 's livelihood and economic development . i , therefore , am of the view that the government should take the initiative to consult those involved in the eia mechanism , and have more exchanges with members of the legislative council so as to ensure that when papers on project funding requests are submitted to the public works subcommittee , there is thorough information . this is to minimize delays due to the need to re-submit information . moreover , to look for effective ways to speed up works , a review of the working procedures of public works is also warranted . furthermore , coming under the most severe attack is the area of project monitoring . in recent years it has been usual for government projects to run into delays , some lasting for three months and some lasting for half a year or even one whole year . the government has been giving people the impression that it is unable to ensure the smooth progress of projects . even though projects apparently have run into delays , there seems to be nothing that the government can do because of various considerations . delays of works have long ceased to be strange as they are so common . paradoxically , it is strange to be able to finish on time . to ensure that the works can progress as scheduled , the works bureau should bring in relevant terms and conditions when preparing contracts and review project monitoring procedures . besides carrying out effective monitoring to detect in time signs of project delays , it is also necessary to act more vigorously . once it is noticed that a contractor has developed problems , strong actions should be initiated in accordance with contract terms so as to take back the work site . if need be , these contractors will undertake minor works at places like hospitals . i suggest that the drainage services department and the territory development department consider hiring term contractors , who can take over the works immediately after the repossession of work sites , and get on with the works until their completion or the invitation of tenders afresh . in this way we can avoid bringing the works to a standstill . furthermore , it can prevent unscrupulous wicked contractors from delaying the projects by taking advantage of loopholes in the area of monitoring . the government departments concerned may also refer to the practice of the hong kong housing authority in setting up a similar system of quality contractors , so as to give recognition to good performances , and also suspend or terminate the tendering eligibility of contractors not complying with contract terms . at present , with those long - term flood prevention projects yet to be completed , the government must expeditiously clean up flooding blackspots in the new territories . as noted by a member , there will probably be another apex when the typhoon hits hong kong this evening . in the long run , the government must thoroughly investigate the pattern of recurrent flooding in various areas so as to formulate a comprehensive contingency plan covering flood forecasting , flood prevention and relief work . furthermore , during the rainy season , it is necessary to make key personnel accessible around the clock so as not to commit the same mistake of the last occasion , when contact could not be established with the contractor concerned . finally , i call upon the government to treat this " old big headache " of solving the new territories flooding problem as a major issue of top priority . if need be , an inter - departmental strategic committee should be set up to industriously , expeditiously and comprehensively solve the problem . i so submit . mr david chu : madam president , as a cosmopolitan city , hong kong measures up to advanced international standards in many areas . however , our flood prevention measures and relief work are not commensurate with the level of our development . in recent years , it has been common for many places in hong kong to have floods during the rainy season . it is especially true of the north and north west new territories , which can easily be turned into flood plains . firemen often have to use rubber boats to rescue those besieged by flood water . the residents , badly suffering from flooding year after year , are deeply troubled both financially and psychologically . flooding is , of course , a natural disaster , but some " human " factors are also involved . the hong kong progressive alliance ( hkpa ) calls upon the government to thoroughly investigate the causes of frequent flooding in various areas , and effect improvement as soon as possible . the new territories flooding problem is not one that crops up just today . judging from different analyses the problem is attributable to the development planning of new towns as well as to delays or negligence in works . in the mid1990s , the government , to develop the new town at tin shui wai , filled up the original river bed to form higher sites , thus turning places in the vicinity into man - made low - lying areas , which are prone to flooding as the water there cannot be drained away when it rains . moreover , land in the new territories is being developed too rapidly and put to different uses . some of the rivers and rainwater drainage systems do not have adequate discharge capacities . so flooding easily occurs . the government already has a series of plans to solve the flooding problem . however , the government has been slack in carrying out monitoring work , as a result of which some projects are being delayed , and individual contractors of some projects have been causing serious flooding by haphazardly dumping wastes , sand and mud , stuffs that may block up the river courses whenever it rains and eventually causing serious floods . madam president , to reduce the damage to the residents , the government should , first of all , expedite the various flood prevention projects . according to the drainage services department ( dsd ) , in the next two or three years villages in different parts of the new territories will still be subject to the threat from flooding as it is going to take another two or three years before various flood prevention projects can be completed one after another . in view of this , the hkpa calls upon the government to expeditiously improve the existing flood forecasting system and the flood contingency mechanism . whenever it rains heavily , the departments concerned and the project contractors must make quick responses by immediately sending out personnel to deal with the flooding , and help to evacuate residents there as soon as possible . pok wai tsuen was flooded on this occasion . however , the contractor 's engineering staff and pumping equipment were not sent there even after a long delay . as a result , great damage was done to the residents . things like that definitely should not be allowed to happen again . finally , the hkpa urges the government to comprehensively review the existing mechanism of tendering . when awarding works contracts , do not neglect quality of works because of price . to ensure that the works can measure up to standard and would not " fail to make their way to the end " , the government must take notice of the contractors ' performance and their financial standing . if the contractor renders poor quality of work or causes delay to the project with the result of doing harm to the residents and society just because he has to tailor his work to suit the price , then the loss will totally outweigh the gain . it even goes against the principle of cost - effectiveness . it is hoped that the government can learn a good lesson from " the incident of defective piling " of home ownership scheme estates . do not commit similar mistakes in the area of public works . with these remarks , madam president , i support the original motion . mr albert ho : madam president , both of the two motion debates conducted in this council today have much to do with the livelihood of the grassroots . the first motion , the one debated earlier on , is on the government 's unreasonable , or even high - handed , land resumption policy . it can be noticed that , because of the government 's unreasonable policy on land resumption , many small enterprises engaged in industrial , commercial and farming activities are unable to stay on . many of those who could have lived and worked in peace and contentment have lost their homes because of the policy on land resumption . all these definitely have something to do with " man - made " factors . turning now to the flooding problem , the topic of the current debate . superficially , it appears to be an uncontrollable natural disaster . however , judging from the information and facts just presented by some fellow members , we can see that this in fact also involves a lot of man - made factors . furthermore , it has something to do with errors in government planning , inefficient policy - making , or , as prof ng ching - fai has said , the lack of determination on the part of the government , or perhaps unwillingness to put in adequate resources . as a result , there has been no success in containing floods . all these lead us to the suspicion that the government is indifferent to grassroots ' livelihood . should the government discharge its duties and look upon people as of prime importance by improving its land resumption policy and alleviating the flooding problem ? madam president , after listening to the speeches of fellow members , i think i need only to add a few points . there are two causes that bring about flooding . natural factors constitute the first cause . some low - lying areas with inadequate drainage systems may easily come under the threat of floods or be affected whenever it rains heavily as the rivers do not have sufficient drainage capacity . of course , this is due to the slow progress seen in government projects . fellow members have just spoken on this . as a result of the completion of various redevelopment projects recently , some villages have become low - lying areas on the urban fringe , which will inevitably turn into blackspots of flooding in time of heavy rain . as far as i know , the government plans to build pumping stations for those areas to help drain away flood water so as to solve the flooding problem . but why are the projects progressing so slowly ? according to schedule , the government will altogether build 12 big pumping stations . so far , only three have been completed . when can the other nine be completed ? as we all know , many villages get flooded several times every year . can the government speed up the construction of pumping stations ? why cannot the works be expedited ? what explanation can the government offer to those affected ? this is my first point . my second point is on the illegal conversion of land uses . under the town planning ordinance , illegal works such as leveling down land , and forming higher sites are not permissible . however , the government is often unable to get the persons concerned to reinstate the sites . as those persons have illegally changed land uses , then are they duty - bound to reinstate the sites ? why cannot the government exercise control ? the fact is that there are so many such illegal constructions that drainage is being affected , leading to the danger of flooding . here comes the third point , which has already been covered by a number of fellow members . with regard to residents of low - lying areas who have long been tortured by the flooding problem , the government has the duty to rehouse them as many as possible at the fastest possible speed , so as to deliver them from such a painful and inhumane living environment . the second cause of the flooding is some of those major projects now underway . recently , the construction of the west rail can be said to be the biggest project . even though many plans are formulated to forestall flooding in the course of the works , they are often not effectively implemented because of inadequate project monitoring . whenever it rains heavily , the works itself may lead to the blockage of drainage systems , thus bringing about flooding at various locations . as a matter of fact , a downpour in april last year brought floods to as many as 60 locations in the northwestern areas . following my personal visits to several villages , i noticed that many villages are adjacent to some work sites of the west rail . that being the case , i have reason to believe that the construction of the west rail has much to do with the flooding on many occasions . though we consider many of the flooding incidents to be attributable to the works of the west rail , the burden of responsibility has not been established . this is most unacceptable to the people . the west rail company just referred all the complaints and claims to the contractors , who , in turn , forwarded them to insurance companies . these insurance companies then called up some so - called adjusters ( that is , surveying firms ) . so far , compensation has been given to only one village . yet , the government is still unable to supply data to clearly establish responsibility . i am of the view that in this respect the government 's responsibility is unshirkable . the drainage services department should have sufficient capability and information to help those residents lodge reasonable claims . madam president , generally speaking , i think the original motion will certainly be passed . i call upon the government to get things done properly right away so as to solve the problem of livelihood for the people ...... president : mr ho , your time is up . mr albert ho : ...... i so submit , thank you . dr raymond ho : madam president , over the last eight years , it has been common for the north and north west new territories to have floods during the rainy season . flooding causes property damage and inconvenience to the residents . it also poses grave safety hazard to them . in june , that is last month , the rainfall was over 1000 mm , breaking the hong kong observatory 's record since 1884 . because of consecutive downpours , low - lying areas in the north and north west new territories naturally experienced extensive flooding , even rendering it necessary to dispatch the government flying service to rescue those besieged by flood water . as a matter of fact , last month 's downpours also caused serious flooding to other places , including belvedere garden in tsuen wan and the villages around tai po . although the government in recent years has had a series of flood prevention works started , the flooding problem remains unsolved , especially in the case of the north and north west new territories . given the fact that local drainage systems and storm water drains cannot keep abreast with the pace of developments , some rapidly - growing new towns are also under potential flooding risks . poor progress of relevant drainage and flood prevention works is often due to delays arising from issues concerning land resumption and compensation . furthermore , there may be a lot of technical problems at the start of works . for instance , public utilities such as underground cables and pipelines can add to the difficulty of drainage works . members of the public probably do understand the difficulties of the authorities concerned . however , this does not give the government the excuse to let the flooding problem deteriorate . in view of the severity and urgency of the flooding problem , i think the government should pinpoint the problems and improve the current procedures and mechanism for land resumption so as to be able to launch some of the more important flood prevention projects . in addition , the government should allocate more funds so as to , on the one hand , expedite flood prevention works , and , on the other hand , step up the cleaning up and dredging of river courses . in the light of the experience stemming from the delay of the training works for river indus , i suggest that the government adopt a milestone arrangement for payment , under which a contractor can get paid only if he manages to complete a specified stage of works within a specified period . in this way , contractual issues and delays due to problems on the part of the contractor that may render it necessary for the government to take back work sites , replace the contractor and arrange another tendering exercise can be avoided . at the same time , to forestall impact on the drainage capacity of nearby drainage channels consequent upon poor management in the course of works , the government should step up the monitoring of various flood prevention projects . as pointed out by me at a special meeting on recent flooding incidents held by the panel on planning , lands and works , a more effective arrangement is for the government 's flood prevention projects not to begin before the start of the rainy season , so as to avoid having projects likely to cause blockage to river courses or drainage channels . to lower the likelihood of flooding , those projects should , as far as possible , be completed before the rainy season . on the other hand , it is also necessary for the government to keep a closer watch over land uses and take prosecution actions against offenders . the reason is that those illegal developments often ignore the problem of drainage , with some even contributing to the blockage of drainage channels . furthermore , the authorities concerned must also put in more efforts to maintain and clean up drainage channels so as to reduce the likelihood of flooding by ensuring their drainage capacity . madam president , the flooding problem has indeed troubled hong kong for a long time , especially so for those victimized . to eradicate the problem , the government should take up the responsibility without delay and identify the causes of flooding . i so submit in support of the original motion whilst opposing the amendment . my opinions above are shared by some fellow members , including mr eric li , mr ng leung - sing , dr lui ming - wah , mr bernard chan , dr lo wing - lok and mr abraham shek . thank you , madam president . mr howard young : madam president , because of on - going downpours over the past few days , different parts of the north district in the new territories are flooded . with low - lying areas suddenly turned into flood plains , residents in the north district are besieged by flood water , losing all their belongings to torrents flooding their homes . again and again before our eyes were telecast scenes showing firemen and rescue teams heroically saving lives in torrents . the bravery and selflessness shown by those rescuers invariably earn my deep respect . at the same time , i cannot but wonder what causes such sufferings to those residents in the north district over the years , and why it is often necessary for our rescue teams to risk their lives to save lives in the torrents , often staging scenes reminiscent of the emergency rescue operations seen in " the burning flame " . according to some new territories residents , the heavy downpour that only occurs once in a decade was not the sole arch criminal responsible for the recent serious flooding . the government 's massive training works for the river course of river indus in the new territories over the past few years should be one of the " prime culprits " too . we can see from television newscast that some contractors piled up on river banks silt and garbage dug up in the course of the works , thus creating earth bunds measuring some 10 ft in height . however , the contractors neither sent away the silt or garbage dug up nor handled the silt properly by , say , covering the debris with plastic sheets so as to prevent rain water from washing it away . when the heavy rain came , rain water mixed with silt simply found its way down the river course , making it even shallower and narrower , which ultimately brought about this serious flooding incident . it is the hope of many local residents that the authorities can keep a proper watch over contractors so as to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents . we also notice that every year in the wake of such incidents the government will invariably " swear to the gods " that improvement will definitely be made to the flood prevention works so as to have the rain water drained away more effectively and forestall the recurrence of flooding . it is , however , disappointing that the situation of flooding in the north district , instead of improving , appears to be getting worse year after year . the liberal party is of the view that in this matter the government 's responsibility is unshirkable . according to the government , a task force chaired by the secretary for works lee shing - see is going to review the flood prevention programme , and study ways to improve flood prevention facilities and the relevant monitoring system , so as to reduce the risks of flooding . we are , however , of the view that , with regard to the delays of flood prevention works , the government cannot pass the buck , but must shoulder the responsibility for the poor management of flood prevention works and learn a lesson from that so as to enhance its monitoring of contractors . the liberal party holds that it is necessary for the government to strengthen in all responsible departments the monitoring process , the quality and safety of projects by , say , conducting more surprise checks or setting up in the departments teams specially responsible for the monitoring of projects . this is to ensure that abnormalities , such as delays or poor quality , can be detected and remedied as soon as possible while the projects are underway . secondly , another principal factor contributing to the flooding of all these years is the delays of flood prevention projects . as we all know , flood prevention works are usually mammoth projects often involving many issues , such as land resumption , public consultation , environmental impact assessment , and a series of complicated legal procedures . at present , under the home affairs department 's policy on rural projects , there cannot be any land resumption ; only letters of consent can provide the avenue to go ahead . in cases involving property interests of private lots , it is often hard for a project to proceed just on account of failure to obtain enough letters of consent . so , the liberal party strongly supports improving the existing mechanisms for land resumption , compensation and rehousing , and allocating additional resources to speed up the flood prevention projects . furthermore , officials of the territory development department ( tdd ) admitted that the project to widen river indus is three months behind schedule because the contractor is short of funds , and that the ultimate completion date will probably be deferred to the end of next year . the liberal party understands that it is normal for works to take time . however , shortage of funds and technical difficulty just cannot provide the justification for the project delay as they are not unforeseeable . the departments concerned , such as the tdd , should have foreseen such obstacles to the works well in advance , and ought to have asked the contractor to make improvement before it was too late . we are of the view that the departments concerned should be held responsible for failure to exercise effective monitoring . it is learnt that the government is considering taking back from the contractor charged with the flood prevention project of river indus some of the works not yet in progress for re-tendering so as to hire another contractor . we welcome such a move by the authorities . it is hoped that the joint efforts of two contractors can speed up the river training works and solve the flooding problem , one that has troubled the north district for years , before the onset of next year 's rainy season . madam president , i so submit and support the amendment as well as the original motion on behalf of the liberal party . mr lau kong - wah : madam president , since this morning , i had continuously sought to know if the meeting today could be held as scheduled . however , to the residents of tin ping shan village , their question since this morning is whether or not they can sleep in peace . ever since 1998 , i have been paying visits to the village around this time of the year to take a look of the aftermath of the flooding , and visit flood victims to note their sufferings . in 1998 , when i made my first visit to the village , i was told by the residents that at the time of the flooding the water level raised up to the waist . so they used many shelves higher than the waist level to keep their cooking utensils . however , when i visited them this year , i was told that the flood water was more than 5 ft deep , that is to say , taller than a person . it can , therefore , be noticed that this year the situation is worse than what it was before the start of the flood prevention works . as i have stated at a panel meeting , the fact that the situation of this year is worse than that of last year is characterized by a few points . firstly , in the past , vegetables in vegetable fields were not covered with mud and sand after a flood , but they were this year . whence came the mud and sand ? secondly , in the past when different stretches of the river course around tin ping shan village overflowed , the flood would not spread beyond tai po . however , in the case of this year , the flood almost covered the upper reaches at tai po . why ? improvement works has been underway , but there has been no improvement and the situation is even getting worse . what problems are being reflected by this ? officials from the territory development department ( tdd ) told us that the impact from sand hills created by flood prevention works was very little . i almost jumped up on hearing that . the reason is that when we took a look from the rooftop of woodland crest , we clearly saw four sand hills 30 ft in height standing on both sides of the river . these sand hills constituted a very important reason why the flood occurred . surely , if the tdd officials had issued warnings but the contractors failed to comply with all the requirements , then the contractors should be held responsible . however , if there had been neither warnings nor preventive measures beforehand , then the tdd should be held responsible . later i asked north district council members , who are also members of the democratic alliance for betterment of hong kong ( dab ) , to find out whether or not there were prior warnings from the tdd , and whether or not they had held discussions with the officials . they told me plainly that they had unequivocally mentioned to local officials well in advance that those sand hills might cause blockage in time of rain , and that at that time the tdd officials took no notice . who should be held responsible under such circumstances ? of course , now the secretary for works has come forward and stated that an investigation will be conducted . madam president , the government is to spend two months on the investigation . then how about those residents tonight ? surely , it is necessary to conduct investigation , but it takes too long . what will be the situation tonight ? can the secretary for works let us know ? as a matter of fact , i deeply share the views just expressed by mr lau wong - fat . if foreigners are told that it takes 10 years to train a river here , they definitely will think that the river is as long as the yangtze river . if they come to take a look and find out that the river course is so short , they will probably be very surprised that even though the training work will have to be done by stages over a period of 10 years , the whole thing still does not work out . i cannot but wonder what is wrong with our officials and projects , and why it is necessary to take so long to train the river course . i remember that when this council granted approval to fund the training works of different river courses , i raised queries at the meeting to find out whether or not the training works of that stretch of the river course should take four years , and whether or not it was possible for the authorities to have the works condensed . i understand that there is flooding every year . we probably do not feel that keenly as we do not live there . however , given the floods that come every year and the fear that is felt every day , those actually living there are bound to have anxiety . but at that time the officials said that nothing could be done about it . why so ? why is it necessary to take four or even 10 years to train that stretch of the river course ? the secretary for works must give an explanation . besides the efficiency issue , there is , i think , definitely a need to quote what mr wong yung - kan once said , and that is : " a year ago , when the tai po district council discussed the flood prevention plan for wai tau tsuen , the official concerned actually thought that the river at wai tau tsuen emptied itself into lam tsuen river before merging with tolo harbour . in fact , the river at wai tau tsuen empties itself into ma wat river via tai hang heung and then flows into shenzhen river . the official responsible for the training works of river is so " blurry " about the direction of the river flow . how can his design prevent floods ? " the situation in tai po is like that . thus , the so - called efficiency issue is also one involving planning . when i looked down from the rooftop of woodland crest , i clearly noticed that woodland crest was totally out of the flooding threat , and that the works were well done . however , the area nearby had been totally turned into a flood plain . at that time i asked the officials concerned why the planning work of that area , one made up mainly of government land , was not properly done , and why it was not possible to rehouse those residents . all these have something to do with the planning done in the past . one final point , madam president . i consider government officials , especially those charged with river training works , to be often " negligent , looking hither and thither and worrying about this and that " . however , we must concern ourselves with the safety of the residents . we should regard their safety and daily inconvenience as top - priority issues . when tracing responsibility , we must still give top priority to residents ' safety . finally , i want to raise questions on behalf of the residents : can the authorities help those residents tonight ? can the authorities complete the works before next year 's rainy season ? thank you , madam president . president : does any member wish to speak ? miss emily lau : madam president , i speak in support of the original motion of dr tang siu - tong and the amendment of the democratic party . in fact , many members have already made mention of a lot of illustrative cases . i am not going to repeat . i hope that today , when the weather is going to be windy and rainy , this council can convey explicitly to mr lee , the secretary for works , and his colleagues a message , namely , that members can no longer put up with these , matters that bring disgrace to hong kong . madam president , i remember that last month the chief executive , when visiting belvedere garden , tsuen wan , said to reporters : " i have told the officials concerned that such things are not allowed to happen again . " however , today it is likely for those things to happen again . i wonder how the secretary for works is going to account to us for that . how did he , after getting the chief executive 's instruction , ensure the non-recurrence of those things ? we , in fact , all understand that it is not possible to bring a total end to all these . however , the authorities should do something as soon as possible . madam president , hong kong does have enough resources to carry out relevant works . surely , we are not going to spend wastefully . given the fact that the flooding problem has been around for years , it is hard for us to face up to those living in the new territories . i agree with what dr tang siu - tong said with regard to the point that it is necessary for the government to conduct an independent investigation . madam president , if we were not having a task force looking into the issue concerning defective piling works , it might have been necessary for us to form a task force to look into the flooding problem . though we are not going to set up such a task force right away , i think the secretary for works should still give explanation , and , in due course , conduct a thorough independent investigation to trace responsibility and state clearly the criteria for compensation . many residents , i believe , have repeatedly suffered damage . they ought to be compensated . i hope that the secretary for works can elaborate upon this in his reply later on . in fact , there is no need for me to repeat as fellow members have already quoted so many illustrative cases . the secretary for works must account for this today . must we wait for another two years , or three years or even five years before there can be any improvement in the situation ? if it is said that the work of the contractor concerned is bad and we have to take back the project for retendering , then , given all the existing problems , how are we going to account to the residents for all that ? must we make use of the resources already available to work out some solutions as soon as possible ? should the authorities instruct the personnel concerned to man their posts continuously ? also asked by dr tang siu - tong is the question why the hotline was not answered when the residents tried to phone it . all these are things that can be accomplished now . with regard to the next few years , when the works have yet to be fully completed , should the government find ways to minimize the residents ' sufferings as far as possible ? with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . president : does any other member wish to speak ? mr albert chan : madam president , i wish to focus on one case , which can prove that the drainage services department ( dsd ) is riddled with problems . because of human errors in management or because of poor co-ordination among departments , belvedere garden has this flooding problem . first of all , i have to declare an interest . i live in that district , where my daughters were born . madam president , just in one single month of june , belvedere garden was flooded thrice . it can be said that it ranks first in hong kong as a flood scene . downpours in june occurred one after another , bringing floods to different places on each occasion . however , according to all the information that i have read , only belvedere garden was flooded three times . no such flooding had ever been experienced there in the 10 - odd preceding years . in my opinion , those floods were 99% attributable to human factors ; that is to say , they are different from floods in other places where floods are caused by some special factors . i am going to speak on the specific circumstances . flooding came for the first time on 9 june . it was said at that time that rocks swept down from the hills by storm water blocked the stormwater drain . the dsd sent workers to the scene to carry out the clean - up , but did not quite finish it . it was flooded again at around 10 o'clock on 11 june , when the rain grew heavier . had the dsd eradicated the factors responsible for the flooding of 9 june or had their workers worked throughout the night of 9 june and 10 june to clear away the rocks , the flooding of 11 june could have been avoided . on 11 june i made an appointment with the dsd officers for a site visit to ascertain the situation . on that occasion , also present there to brief the dsd officers on the flooding of 9 june were some residents of belvedere garden . according to a resident , it could be seen from his home that water was rushing down from the catchwaters on the hills like bursting mountain torrents , sweeping across tuen mun road , and flushing down the road surface like waterfall . belvedere garden is located in a valley in the hills , where water was also rushing down like bursting mountain torrents . beside the drainage channels are some residential structures , schools and low - rise village houses . by the side of the drainage channel is a dsd - built 10 - foot - high retaining wall . never before in the preceding decade or two had i encountered such a chilling scene . at 3 pm on 11 june , i talked to the dsd representatives about the issue . residents of belvedere garden also told them what it was like at the time of bursting mountain torrents . the dsd representatives said that they would contact the water supplies department ( wsd ) immediately as the wsd was totally responsible for water rushing down from the hills , which was not caused by the dsd works . regarding problems with the catchwaters on the hills , it is because over the past two years or so , there have been a lot of hillslope and catchwater works going on . in fact , we have made site visits , and are aware of the blockage of catchwaters due to works done for hillslopes . on 11 june i explained clearly to the dsd representatives all the causes and problems . at that time they said that they would arrange to spray chunam plaster on the parts of the hillslopes that had collapsed . the dsd representatives said that actions would be taken . but on 23 june there came a downpour which was not too heavy . madam president , that was just a downpour experienced once in a decade or two . it was not heavy enough to be a rainstorm . as a matter of fact , in many cases the design of new towns can withstand rainstorm experienced only once in 50 years . that is to say , there should be no flooding if it is not a rainstorm experienced only once in 50 years . however , there was another flood on 23 june and the causes for that were similar to those of the last two occasions , that is water overflowing from catchwaters and rushing down to tuen mun road from the hills . the situation on that occasion was even more serious . at about eight o'clock some boulders got swept down to tuen mun road , fortunately causing no traffic accidents . that was indeed sheer luck amidst calamities . it so happened that i drove past tuen mun road at half past eight and noticed that by the side of the road was a boulder measuring about 2 ft by 3 ft . the police had just closed the road . had the dsd taken all the necessary actions after obtaining all the information on 11 june , then the flooding of 23 june would not have happened . that day a child was swept away by torrents . fortunately , an estate manager risked his own life to save the child . falling boulders can be deadly too . the incident of a child being swept away by torrents in a town centre just sounds ridiculous even though the place is in a housing estate , not in the downtown area . afterwards , we had further site visits , discussions and meetings with the dsd officers . it is our hope that the dsd can improve both their internal attitude in dealing with things and their code of practice . the department was well aware of the blockage affecting drainage channels and the fact that the rain would continue . why did they not carry out the clean - up throughout the night ? i explained everything at the meeting on 11 june . but there again came the flooding on 23 june . the dsd has again and again mentioned to me that the department has formulated a plan on flood prevention tunnels that is going to require several billion dollars for the construction of flood prevention tunnels at different places . when so informed , i told the secretary for works that , given the fact that not even such a minor matter was handled properly , he should not hold any hope that the finance committee would approve the appropriation of several billion dollars to let the dsd build flood prevention tunnels if the department under his supervision had been so remiss in discharging its duties with regard to administration and the handling of problems as that was indicative of the department 's incompetence . even more ridiculous is that for several consecutive weeks there has been flooding . for some 20 days , 70% of the roadside drains in the castle peak road area around the factory buildings near belvedere garden were totally blocked . i had to ask my secretary to phone the dsd to ask them to send their workers to unblock the drains . the dsd has been totally remiss in discharging its duties , whether in respect of minor issues or contingency and crisis management . if the secretary for works is unable to deal with matters in the department properly , then do not consider implementing any flood prevention plan , for the dsd will only keep wasting taxpayers ' money . the problem can only get worse if it is still left under the leadership of incompetent officials . mr wong yung - kan : madam president , it can be recalled that in 1991 the government , at a cost of several billion dollars , launched a 10- year flood prevention programme in the wake of a serious flood in north new territories , confidently stating that the programme would be able to alleviate the flooding problem of north new territories . ten years have gone by . however , north new territories still looks like a flood plain whenever it rains heavily . people often say that " a geomancer may fool you for eight or 10 years . " it is unthinkable that officials in charge of flood prevention have also fooled us for 10 years . in order that flood prevention works in the new territories can be done properly , it is necessary to formulate a set of well - planned measures of substantial projects , which , however , must be supplemented by measures of non-substantial projects . on taking a comprehensive view of the government 's flood prevention efforts over the decade , it can be noted that whilst the plan for substantial projects is not thorough , measures of non-substantial projects are nothing serious . as a result , the safety and properties of new territories villagers are put at risk . now on substantial projects . flood mitigation projects should be a system issue . it is necessary for the authorities to take charge of the water system of one whole district . at the time of project design it is necessary to take an macroscopic view to see if the flooding will go somewhere else upon the completion of flood prevention project at a certain place . however , the government tends to act with the mentality of only " treating the symptoms but not the diseases " . take tai po 's tai hang heung as an example . given the fact that the flood prevention project for that village was completed in 1996 , the flooding problem previously affecting the area around the village office ought to have been eliminated . however , it is now turned into a flood zone . measures of non-substantial projects refer to government mechanisms for land resumption , compensation and rehousing , flood prevention measures as well as the government 's monitoring system . if measures of non-substantial projects are no good , it is still futile despite flawless planning for substantial projects . madam president , the government often blames delays of projects on the difficulty to resume land , thus implying that landowners have been making things difficult . how come the government does not review its land resumption procedures , which are so complicated that in some cases it takes 18 months to resume the land ? now underway in north new territories are many civil engineering projects . sand and mud dug up and piled up beside the river often create potential hazards likely to bring about flooding . according to north district council members who are also members of the democratic alliance for betterment of hong kong ( dab ) , at a committee meeting of the north district council held two months ago , they conveyed the point regarding the potential safety hazard posed by sand and mud dug up from the river bed of river indus and piled up along both sides of the river course by the contractor of river indus . according to the contractor , it was not possible to remove those sand and mud then as they were needed for other purposes . at that time some committee members suggested that those sand and mud be covered by canvas sheets so as to reduce the risk of their being washed away by rain . however , officials of the territory development department ( tdd ) present at the meeting totally ignored members ' opinions , which partially contributed to bringing about last month 's serious flooding . not even the contractor training the river , not to mention other contractors , heeded the risk he brought forth ! i am of the view that those tdd officials should be punished as their bureaucratic behaviour is responsible for this man - made calamity . moreover , following last month 's flooding , i , together with mr lau kong - wah , went to take a look at the disaster scene along river indus . we were informed by a worker working at the work site that it was common for workers to have wages in arrears . in his case , his wages were half a year in arrears . this is indicative of problems existing in the contractor 's internal administration that can cause delays to the works . madam president , it is not uncommon for the government , when building transport infrastructure in the new territories , to cut off access roads passing through villages without providing remedial measures . in this way , villagers ' rights to go outside are jeopardized , and rescue operations in time of flooding , fire and medical emergency are also hindered . the sole access road to the outside world for the four villages at kau lung hang , tai po , was cut off in the early 1980s to make room for the circular road and the tracks of the electric train . the government just deepened the river bed under the railway bridge to provide the only access road to the outside world . when there is a rainstorm and water starts gathering , it will become a river course again . at the time of last month 's flooding , rain water swept cars into the river ; firemen and television reporters almost ran into grave danger too . i call upon the government to honour its promise and make use of the opportunity offered by the widening works of tolo highway to build a proper rescue road for the four villages at kau lung hang as soon as possible . in dr tang siu - tong 's motion are several suggestions , which , in my opinion , do hit the bull 's eye . i totally agree with him and would like to add a point . my suggestion is that the government should establish a system requiring all parties , whether government or private developers , wishing to launch development projects in a flood - prone zone in the future to carry out assessment to see if the items of development are likely to damage local flood prevention systems or not . if yes , a remedial plan will then have to be provided . according to legend , dayu took 13 years to combat flooding . our combat against flooding has been in progress for 10 full years , but to no avail yet . i wonder if the government , after the debate in this council today , can promise to , first of all , put into effect short - term measures to alleviate flooding within the next three years , and then , thoroughly complete all the flood prevention works . madam president , i so submit . mr lau ping - cheung : madam president , in june this year , the hong kong observatory recorded a rainfall total of 1083 mm , an all - time high record in the history of hong kong . at the same time , the observatory altogether issued five red rainstorm warning signals and 17 amber rainstorm warning signals . because of the continuous downpours , different areas in the western and the northern parts of the new territories were flooded . more than 100 villagers were besieged by flood water and had to be rescued by firemen and members of other disciplined services . if the flooding incident was really a natural disaster , then we definitely should not blame god and man . however , it can be observed on taking a closer look that the most badly flooded places are those with ongoing flood prevention works . the principal factor leading to the flooding was the failure on the part of those working on the projects to guard against flood water , which rendered it impossible to drain away the flood water in time , and thus had the disaster exacerbated . is that not the greatest irony ? according to what villagers said regarding the flooding at pok wai tsuen , yuen long , on 7 june , flooding was first noticed at 4 am . non-stop attempts were made to lodge complaints with the drainage services department ( dsd ) and the project contractor by phone . not until about 7 am did the dsd engineer manage to establish contact with the contractor and get the latter to go there to start the pump to pump away the water . the whole process took more than three hours . as a matter of fact , it was foreseen before the start of the project that pok wai tsuen would come under the threat of flooding in the course of the works . so arrangements were made to provide a temporary pump and deployment of stand - by engineering staff . however , neither dsd staff nor the contractor had any sense of crisis awareness , and thus failed to take the threat of flooding seriously . as a result , no immediate notice was given even though the telephone number for contact had changed ; the rainstorm warning from the observatory went unheeded . when informed by the villagers of the flooding , they still took a site visit in compliance with the procedures , and notified the contractor only after verifying the flooding incident . such procrastination rendered all arrangements ineffective . paradoxically enough , the contractor manned the work site with stand - by staff throughout the night after the problems came to light . sure enough , the above arrangements functioned very well in the next few days of rainstorm , and there was no serious flooding . there was flooding too at tin ping shan village , sheung shui , where river training works have been in progress . according to report , the contractor proceeded at a very slow speed before the flooding incident . it is also reported that shortage of funds and technical problems on the part of the contractor also caused delays to the works . meanwhile , the contractor had been dredging the river course and piling up silt beside the river , but failed to remove the silt in time or take stopgap protective measures . in the wake of the flooding , villagers found a lot of sand and mud along the river course . they suspected that it was the silt swept back into the river by rain water that brought about the flooding . i do not want to jump to a conclusion immaturely . however , the flooding at tin ping shan village brought to light another problem . with regard to stopgap arrangements during the course of the works , the government 's requirements for private development projects are very strict . for instance , it is not permissible to accumulate too much sand and mud and it is necessary to build temporary retaining walls and temporary drainage channels and so on . by this incident , the government has given us the impression of playing double standards by " being strict with others but lenient with itself " . the government should also give the public an explanation . are the temporary measures required by the government to be done by consultants and contractors good enough to prevent flooding ? the reason is that some of the temporary measures seen by villagers tend to narrow the river course , and greatly increase the threat of flooding in the course of the works . has the government ever sent officers to check the project at tin ping shan village after contracting it out ? have the consultant and the contractor been asked to provide temporary flood prevention arrangements , such as regularly clearing the work site of silt and junks , installing enough temporary drainage pipes , covering silt not taken away with makeshift plastic sheets or by hydroseeding , and heightening the makeshift river banks ? all these are problems of project management , and must not be taken lightly . both dr tang siu - tong and mr wong sing - chi ask the government to allocate additional resources to speed up flood prevention projects . i am of the view that a more fundamental approach should be adopted to deal with this issue . in the past i queried the government , asking the government to divide the projects into smaller items for participation by more contractors , so as to effectively speed up the projects . however , the government has been saying " no " to this with some lame arguments . take the river training works at tin ping shan village as an example . had the project been broken up into smaller units , then there would not have been excessive reliance on one single contractor , and delays , if any , could have been detected earlier . not until now , with the problem already surfaced , does the government indicate that it will consider taking back part of the project for re-assignment to other contractors . this wastes both time and efforts , to say nothing about the extra spending to be incurred for the project . surely , if projects are to be broken up into smaller units , it is going to be necessary for government departments to keep a closer watch on the progress of works and arrange co-ordination among contractors . however , i am of the view that , in order to ensure the progress and quality of works , government departments should have greater involvement in the works . to do so is , after all , better than to trace the responsibility after things have already gone wrong . finally , i have to point out that the overall land use in the new territories is also a principal factor bringing about flooding . as pointed out by me earlier on in the motion debate on " reviewing the compensation policy on land resumption " , as a result of a freeze on most of the land uses in the new territories by the government in the 1990s , many freight - transport - related trades were unable to find suitable sites for their use , and had to operate illegally , causing damage to the original foundations of sites , making it hard for rain water to drain away quickly and thus bringing about the flooding problem . according to the criticism recently made by a famous local businessman openly , the freeze on land uses is a very stupid measure as it neither satisfies economic needs nor solves the problem . we , in fact , should actively consider the needs of the freight transport trade , and draw up appropriate plans which , while setting aside enough land , must require the operators to put in place drainage systems dovetailing with the government 's overall flood prevention system . let the consideration be one for the whole society . every year there come floods differing in magnitude that bring with them threats of infectious diseases like cholera , digestive infections and even the rare leptospria interrogans . the whole society has to pay for all these . madam president , four years have gone by since the recovery of sovereignty over hong kong . it is my hope that members of the civil service can be more duty - conscious in dealing with their daily public affairs . according to the secretary for works , the government has spent $7 billion to carry out flood prevention works in the north new territories . however , it may not be possible to solve problems in consequence of procrastination merely by spending money on projects . i so submit . mr henry wu : madam president , according to information from the drainage services department ( dsd ) , hong kong 's average annual rainfall stands at about 2200 mm , placing hong kong among the most rainy cities along the pacific rim . however , as pointed out by the chief executive mr tung chee - hwa earlier on at a question and answer session of this council , plans were drawn up by the authorities as early as in 1993 to deal with the flooding problem in the new territories and that in kowloon at a cost of about $7 billion and $5 billion respectively in the following decade . how come after a lapse of eight years , the low - lying areas in our northern part and some old urban areas are still flooded seriously during the typhoon season or in time of rainstorm ? there are other factors other than those said by the authorities , namely , the long delays and non-completion of drainage improvement projects . i am of the view that there is a more fundamental factor and that is , the flood protection standards of the drainage works concerned being unable to cope with the actual situation . according to the dsd information , different drainage systems have different flood protection standards capable of withstanding severe flood events at the so - called " average recurrence intervals " . that is probably similar to our oft - said flood event experienced once in 10 or 15 years . for instance , the flood protection standard for urban drainage trunk systems should be capable of withstanding flood event experienced once in 200 years ; the urban drainage branch systems and the main rural catchment drainage channels should be designed with a flood prevention standard capable of withstanding flood event experienced once in 50 years ; village drainage systems should satisfy a protection standard of once every 10 years ; and intensively used agricultural land should satisfy a standard of once in every two to five years . madam president , i am not an expert in matters of drainage or flood prevention . it is beyond my scope of responsibility to determine the types of drainage systems or to set the flood prevention standards for the designs . whilst the authorities often stresses that the flood prevention standard for major channels is one capable of withstanding flood event experienced once in 50 years , yet in recent years there have been serious floods year after year . people just wonder why it so happens that downpours supposed to occur at 50 - years intervals have been coming back one after another to become " monthly events " in recent years . there is another irrefutable fact , namely , that every year when flooding occurs , the worst - hit areas are places in the north west new territories , such as yuen long and sheung shui . residents in affected villages often find themselves suddenly becoming upstarts , each owning " a private indoor swimming pool " . according to the flood prevention standards set by the dsd , the flood prevention standard of village drainage system surprisingly happens to be lower than that set for urban areas . surely , when drawing up plans for drainage works , the government must consider factors like cost effectiveness and the social and economic impacts of flooding . given the fact that every year residents in north new territories must face the plight of " having water at the doorway of their rooms " like being " besieged " , it is really necessary for the authorities to comprehensively review flood prevention standards so as to ensure that they are congruent with the actual situation . it is especially so in the case of the new territories , where , following rapid growth in recent years , new towns are growing in number and the population is growing in size quickly . however , the flood prevention standards currently in use are based on phase 1 of the territorial land drainage and flood control strategy study , which was completed in 1990 , and phase 2 of the territorial land drainage and flood control strategy study , which was completed in 1993 . however , it is believed that the conclusions drawn by those studies were based on information of the late 1980s . it is beyond doubt that , when compared with the situation of the early 1990s , urban developments in the new territories and the economic development of hong kong these days have undergone significant changes . even though there is less and less agricultural land , the economic losses , the cost of rescue and follow - up operations and the government 's compensation payments to be incurred in the event of flooding are going to be much greater than what they were before . anyway , people 's safety should always be given top concern . members of the public are put at risk while rescuers also have to run the risk of being swept away by torrents at any moment . though a lot of efforts have been put in over the years , the perennial flooding problem in the new territories still remains unsolved . i think the authorities concerned should be held responsible , particularly blameworthy with regard to the progress of works and their monitoring . according to the estimates of the dsd , it is going to take another seven years before the flood prevention works in the north district of the new territories can be completed even though they have already been in progress for eight years . the heavy rain that came early last month caused serious flooding to north west new territories . many villagers later criticized the authorities for failing to exercise effective monitoring , hindering the dispersal of rain water by allowing the contractors to pile up debris all over the place , and ultimately bringing about a even more serious flooding problem . i remember that at a meeting of the public works subcommittee of this council held in late may , an official pointed out that the drainage capacity of land was affected because some villagers had levelled and cemented their farmland for some other uses . apparently , that was an attempt to pass the buck . given the illegality involved in the change of land uses , why did the authorities not take actions earlier ? this precisely is indicative of its failure to exercise effective monitoring and law - enforcement . following the serious flooding in north west new territories in june , the authorities responded quickly to people 's resentment with , for instance , a meeting immediately summoned by the chief executive , a team quickly set up by the dsd to investigate the causes of the flooding , and a task force established under the chairmanship of the secretary for works to review the flood prevention programmes . i , however , hope that this time the departments concerned and the task force will treat seriously matters concerning project design and monitoring . it is necessary to take appropriate actions on detecting negligence or some other human factors . it is because right in the centre of downtown there is an even bigger flood hazard - nathan road in mong kok . a stormwater drainage improvement project for nathan road was completed in june 1999 . however , at present it can only withstand downpour producing about 50 mm of rainfall an hour ( that is , rainfall for the red rainstorm warning ) . in other words , in the next three years , when the flood prevention works for west kowloon have yet to be completed , mong kok may again become a flood plain when a black rainstorm warning is issued . it is also going to be inevitable for shop - operators close to the blackspot to sustain economic losses unnecessarily . they will also suddenly become " upstarts " - with " private indoor swimming pools " inside their shops ! so , the present situation brooks no delay . it is necessary for the authorities to put in place all the relevant flood prevention works as soon as possible . madam president , i so submit . president : does any other member wish to speak ? ( no member responded ) president : dr tang siu - tong , you may now speak on mr wong sing - chi 's amendment . you have up to five minutes to speak . dr tang siu - tong : madam president , i am going to respond to the three amendments to my motion moved by mr wong sing - chi . in the first place , i am moving this motion primarily out of a wish to enable the legislative council to make more comments or recommendations on flood prevention measures so as to bring perfection to flood prevention efforts . i have considered using stronger wording . but i fear that the focus might be shifted to the question as to whether or not the government should be " strongly condemned " . if so , then the debate may be turned into a denunciation rally . perhaps that would not contribute much to solving the flooding problem . though major flood prevention projects do manifest problems of delay and inadequate monitoring , the administration has , after all , got a lot of flood prevention works started and completed . it is a little too harsh to accuse the government of " turning a blind eye to flooding problem over the years " and to " strongly condemn " it for that . it is , however , necessary for the government to find out where the problems are and put in efforts to effect improvement . in the second place , also inserted in the amendment is a part that reads " expeditiously rehousing eligible residents of seriously flooded areas in public housing " . what kind of residents does the word " residents " in the amendment refer to ? are they residents with homes permanently destroyed ? or are they residents affected as a result of their homes being flooded with water for a short time ? for those in the former case , that is , those with homes permanently destroyed , under the current policy of the housing authority ( ha ) , those losing their homes as a result of natural disasters ( flooding included ) will be quickly ( normally not exceeding one month ) rehoused in public housing . there appears to be no need to insert this point . how about those in the latter case ? i agree that the ha should exercise discretion to speed up the applications from those persistently affected by flooding . if those living in " seriously flooded areas " are to be automatically allowed to move in public housing units earlier , then seemingly it is unfair to the other applicants on the waiting list . furthermore , because of this , many people , in a bid to move in public housing units earlier , may move to flood - prone zones . such a broadbrush approach , will inevitably lead to abuses . i certainly agree that society should first of all take care of those living in flood - prone zones and facing imminent danger . in the third place , the " environmental blackspots " referred to in paragraph ( e ) of my version in fact denote those environmental blackspots on sites classified as " existing uses " and those " unauthorized developments " in rural areas primarily handled by the task force ( black spots ) of the lands department and the central enforcement and prosecution section of the planning department . when reporting to this council on their work , the two units mentioned above usually use a title that reads " cleaning up environmental blackspots in the new territories " . that being the case , i , therefore , use the term " environmental blackspots " to cover the two categories of land administration problems commonly seen in the new territories . for the same reason , the cleaning up referred to in the original motion in fact includes prosecution actions . that being the case , i , therefore , believe that paragraph ( e ) of the original motion already covers paragraph ( f ) of the amendment . only the way of expression and the choice of words by both of us are somehow open to question . madam president , on account of the above reasons , i will abstain from voting on the amendment . secretary for works : madam president , we share very much the ordeal of the people affected by the recent flooding in the new territories and feel deeply sorry for them . our heart sank every time we saw people being trapped in the floods ; we just wished that the flooding problem could be resolved immediately . but then , flood control and prevention is indeed a mammoth task that takes time to accomplish . nevertheless , in view of the sufferings of the affected residents , we will certainly try our best to ensure the stringent implementation of our flood prevention projects and expeditiously complete all long - term and short - term improvement works . we will seek all practicable methods to speed up the various project works to bring relief to the affected villagers . the aim of all our work is to tackle flooding and bring an end to the sufferings of villagers living in low - lying areas as soon as possible . we will certainly take note of the invaluable opinions and suggestions put forward by honourable members and constantly urge all relevant departments to adopt proactive measures to tighten up monitoring of the progress of anti-flooding works and site supervision , with a view to resolving expeditiously the flooding problem in the new territories . as a matter of fact , we have all along been very concerned about the long - term sufferings of residents living in the new territories affected by floods . since the early ' 90s , the government has been proactively conducting a series of flood prevention studies and formulated , on the basis of those studies , a series of flood prevention measures at a total cost of over $7 billion and the timetable for implementing such measures . as at present , we have already completed projects totalling about $3 billion and improved the flood prevention capacity of the lower streams of major river channels . in addition to actively carrying out drainage improvement works in the midstream and downstream sections of major rivers at a cost of over $2 billion , we are also planning improvement works for the upper stream of rivers currently . over the past years , heavy rain would often result in flooding in the low - lying areas in the new territories . i believe members all understand that flood water can only be drained to the sea via natural river channels . but since these river courses are mostly meandering and narrow , substantial amounts of floodwater cannot be speedily carried to the sea during rainstorms and flooding is thus resulted . the flooding will be even more severe when there are high tides . our first and foremost task is to straighten , widen and deepen the courses of natural rivers and to strengthen their capacity of draining flood water . at the same time , we also need to construct flood control pumping stations for villages in low - lying areas , so that flood water can be pumped out of the villages to the drainage channels nearby . as i said just now , river training as a whole is a mammoth task and so , it must be implemented in an orderly manner . otherwise , the works involved will only serve to pose greater nuisance to the daily lives of the residents nearby . on the other hand , in order to avoid aggravating the flooding risk in the affected areas , drainage improvements must be carried out in sequence from the lower stream , through the midstream sections and then up to upstream sections to enhance the drainage capacity of rivers step by step . perhaps let me now give members a brief account of the progress and initial results of the flood prevention works that we have carried out over the past years . we have already completed river training works costing about $3 billion in the downstream sections of major river channels . in north west new territories , we have completed the river training works in tin shui wai as early as in 1995 , enhancing the drainage capacity of about 10 km of the river courses in the area . in early 1999 , we also completed the improvement works along some 10 km of the shan pui river in kam tin , yuen long . in the north west new territories , as stages i and ii of the shenzhen river regulation project have already been completed , the flood prevention capacity of a total length of 10 km of the downstream section of shenzhen river has been greatly improved . since the completion of the downstream improvement works , initial improvement has been made to the flood water draining capacity of rivers in the northern and northwestern parts of the new territories . as a result , the flood - prone areas in the vicinity of tin shui wai , shan pui river in yuen long and lo wu have become smaller in size . even though some of the areas there may still face flooding risks in the short run , the flood extent has been notably reduced and the flood water has receded more quickly . at present , tens of thousands of residents in these areas have been relieved of the threat of flooding . in the past , there were many flooding blackspots , such as tsung pak long , tai tao leng and sheung shui tsuen in sheung shui ; tak yuet lau and yin kong in lo wu ; ho sheung heung ; kwu tung ; sha po tsuen , ko po tsuen , and kam hing wai in kam tin ; lo uk tsuen , sik kong tsuen , sik kong wai , kiu tau wai , hang mei san tsuen and fung shui lane in tin shui wai ; and so on . since the completion of the relevant flood prevention works there , these places are now relieved of the plights caused by flooding . nevertheless , our flood prevention efforts have never slackened . on the contrary , we have actively speeded up works at major rivers over the past two to three years . we are currently carrying out midstream and downstream improvement works at a cost of over $2 billion , involving a total of 12 major projects . in north west new territories , for example , the river training works in a 10 km long midstream section of kam tin river in yuen long are now well underway . besides , we are also constructing some 8 km long drainage channels for shap pat heung and ngau tam mei in yuen long . as regards the north new territories , having completed the improvement works in the downstream section of shenzhen river , we have commenced the river training works in the midstream and downstream sections of river beas and river indus in early 1999 to improve comprehensively some 16 km of the natural river courses in the vicinity of sheung shui . upon the completion of these projects in or before 2003 , the flooding situation in the new territories will be improved significantly , thereby relieving more residents living in low - lying areas of the plights of flooding . regarding the flood prevention projects for villages , in addition to building weirs around low - lying villages to prevent the influx of flood water , we will also construct flood control pumping stations to pump the rainwater collected within the weirs to the drainage channels nearby . that way , villages in low - lying areas will be shielded from flooding . over the past few years , we have altogether completed 12 village flood prevention programmes in the northern and northwestern parts of the new territories , providing protection for 16 villages in low - lying areas . these completed programmes are functioning rather satisfactorily and have effectively resolved the flooding problem for the villages concerned . to further enhance the flood prevention capacity of the new territories , we are now actively planning comprehensive river training projects for the upstream sections of certain natural river courses in the new territories . subject to the completion of the midstream and downstream river training works currently in progress , the flood prevention projects under planning at the moment will be commenced one after another , with a view to resolving completely the flooding problem in the new territories in the long run . early last month , the amber rainstorm warning has for the first time been issued on six days in a row . besides , a red rainstorm warning was also issued for a period of 5.5 hours by the observatory on 27 june . the rainfall recorded in june this year is the highest in the past 100 years or so . on those few days when rainfall was the heaviest , severe flooding was resulted in the northern parts of the new territories , including areas in the vicinity of tin ping shan , shek wu san tsuen , man kam to and ta kwu ling . in fact , just like honourable members , the government is also very much concerned about the sufferings of residents affected by floods . as members may know , the government has already set up a special task force to review comprehensively the progress of the various flood prevention projects . furthermore , the task force will also look into measures to ensure that the major flood prevention projects that have already been commenced will be completed by 2003 , and that effective short - term improvement measures will be adopted before the completion of such projects to alleviate the flooding risk facing the new territories . the task force , chaired by me and comprises members including the director of drainage services , director of territory development and director of home affairs , has held two meetings respectively on the 13th and 29th of last month to review the progress of the various flood prevention projects . the task force is confident that upon the completion of the river training works in the midstream and downstream sections of major rivers in 2003 , the flooding situation in the new territories will be significantly improved . the task force is also aware that some of the flood prevention works carried out in the midstream and downstream sections of river indus have indeed been delayed . hence , the relevant works departments have been urged by the task force to adopt appropriate measures to overcome the difficulties facing them currently and to monitor more closely the progress of the projects , so as to ensure that the key parts of the projects will be completed before the rainy season of 2003 or even earlier , thereby alleviating expeditiously the flooding problem in the vicinity of tin ping shan village . apart from that , the task force has also urged the works departments concerned to adopt various short - term measures to minimize the flooding risk in areas affected by the projects and works . these measures include stepping up site supervision to ensure smooth flow of river channels , strengthening ties with residents living in the affected areas to ensure that rescue work can be commenced at the earliest possible time , as well as improving the logistic resources at work sites to cater for the emergency needs arising during foul weather conditions . as regards the concern expressed by members over the question as to whether or not the recent flooding cases were caused by the river training projects currently in progress , in - depth and thorough investigations need to be conducted to find out their causes . i have instructed the director of drainage services to complete the report on the investigations before the end of august . we will also invite independent experts to review the report produced by the drainage services department , with a view to ensuring that a professional , reasonable and fair conclusion can be reached . in the event of the report pointing out that certain contractors should be held accountable , the government will definitely handle the matter impartially . we will require the contractors concerned to offer reasonable compensation to the affected residents on the one hand , and assist the affected residents to claim compensation from relevant contractors on the other . in the meantime , a number of government departments , such as the home affairs department , agriculture , fisheries and conservation department , social welfare department , housing department , and so on , have , since the flooding incidents , provided the affected residents and farmers with various kinds of emergency assistance including cash grants from the emergency relief fund , with a view to alleviating the economic hardships of the affected residents and helping them to resume their normal lives as soon as possible . so far , the various government departments have granted a total of over $6 million emergency assistance payments to residents and farmers affected by the recent flooding incidents . just now members also discussed ways to expeditiously carry out the remaining flood prevention projects under planning . actually , it is a common objective of both the government and members to expeditiously implement the flood prevention projects , and the government will continue to listen carefully to the views and suggestions made by members in order to step up efforts in this respect . i wish to stress again that the anti-flooding programme involves a wide range of areas ; in addition to planning , design and implementation , we also need time to consult extensively the residents living in affected areas , resolve environmental issues , and complete land resumption and other necessary statutory procedures . the relevant legal proceedings , for example , normally require two to three years to complete . with regard to the resumption of private land , there are already mechanisms whereby matters like land resumption arrangements , compensation and rehousing can be handled . i understand that this council has just passed a motion to urge the government to review such issues as land resumption procedure and rates of compensation payments . i believe the departments concerned will certainly follow up the matter . however , under the present procedure , the amount of time required for land resumption is very often subject to both the provisions of the relevant ordinances and the limitation of the actual environment . given that land resumption involves considerations such as public interest and public land use , the government has to follow the statutory procedures provided under the relevant legislation to safeguard the interests of the public . from the motion debate today i understand that members are gravely concerned about the relief work and contingency arrangements that the government has in place to deal with flooding incidents . in this connection , i do agree that relief work must be well planned beforehand . during rainstorms , the drainage services department will activate the emergency co-ordination centre to handle complaints of floods and adopt proper measures to alleviate the flooding situation . in order to minimize the losses that residents have to suffer due to flooding , the drainage services department has set up regional flooding warning systems in seven flood - prone areas to warn residents of flooding risk when flood water reaches the pre-set alarm level . in the recent flooding incident , i believe the various government departments , including the police force , fire services department , government flying service , home affairs department , social welfare department , housing department , agriculture , fisheries and conservation department and drainage services department , have given full play to their team spirit in a concerted action to expeditiously provide rescue and relief services for the affected residents . another point i need to stress is the importance of preventive inspection to ensure the smooth flow and proper maintenance of drainage systems . the drainage services department has formulated continuous preventive maintenance programmes to ensure that the maximum drainage capacity of major drainage systems can always be maintained . every year , the drainage services department will enhance its efforts in this respect before and during the rainy season . the total amount of silt dredged from these drainage systems is over 110 000 cu m every year . i understand that members are very much concerned that unauthorized land use in the new territories may become a factor aggravating the flooding risk . in fact , it is an offence under the town planning ordinance ( as amended in 1991 ) to make any unapproved alteration to land use or to arbitrarily carry out land formation work , and is liable to a maximum fine of $1 million upon conviction . both the planning department and the lands department have conducted inspections and exercised regulation and have instituted prosecution against unauthorized land uses . further still , the government will also order the relevant landowners to improve the existing facilities in line with the original land use , so as to ensure that such facilities can meet the various safety , environmental and drainage requirements . so far the government has successfully terminated the authorized use of some 690 hectares of land or incorporated them into lawful uses upon approval by the planning department . the government will continue to step up its effort in this respect to combat unauthorized land use . many members have spoken on the importance of monitoring contractors during this motion debate today . we very much agree with members . perhaps let me spend a bit more time to expound the policy of the government . it has been our long - standing policy to appoint contractors in an open and fair manner and in accordance with the value - for - money principle . contractors have to meet the prescribed technical and financial requirements in order to be eligible to bid for public works contracts , and only those contractors with good performance will be hired by the government . if we suspect any contractor of performing poorly or involving in serious incidents during the contractual period , or if we have proven that such is the case , we will review whether the contractors concerned are still eligible to bid for public works contracts . early this year , we formulated a set of measures to enhance the supervision over contractors . we will take regulatory actions against contractors that have received two consecutive unsatisfactory appraisal reports ( rather than three such reports as in the past ) , such as suspending their eligibility for bidding public works contracts , downgrading their qualification for bidding public works contracts . in more serious cases , we will remove the names of the contractors concerned from the government 's approved list of contractors and ban them from bidding public works contracts . to ascertain whether or not contractors have the required financial capacity to carry out the public works concerned , we have raised the relevant capital requirements . moreover , we will also analyse the profit - earning trend of contractors and assess their present financial situation in the light of their rates of loss in the past three years . we believe that the aforementioned measures will help us to monitor effectively the performance and conditions of contractors . on top of the measures that i mentioned just now , we will also actively follow up the recommendations made by the construction industry review committee to ensure that the quality and progress of all government projects are duly assured . lastly , i wish to stress again that the government has always attached great importance to the flooding problem in the new territories and is very much concerned with the sufferings of residents under the threat of flooding . that is why we have formulated a comprehensive flood prevention programme and actively devoted substantial resources in resolving the flooding problem in the new territories . the various projects and works are either under planning , design or construction currently . such a large - scale flood prevention programme will take quite some time to complete fully . during the construction stage , we will certainly step up efforts to monitor the progress of the projects , push contractors to improve the management of work sites , and strive to complete the river training projects in the midstream and downstream sections of major rivers before the rainy season in 2003 or earlier , so as to alleviate the long - term flooding problem in the new territories and to improve the living environment of residents living in low - lying areas . thank you , madam president . president : i now put the question to you and that is : that the amendment , moved by mr wong sing - chi to dr tang siu - tong 's motion , be passed . will those in favour please raise their hands ? ( members raised their hands ) president : those against please raise their hands . ( members raised their hands ) dr tang siu - tong rose to claim a division . president : dr tang siu - tong has claimed a division . the division bell will ring for three minutes . president : will members please proceed to vote . president : will members please check their votes . if there are no queries , voting shall now stop and the result will be displayed . functional constituencies : mr kenneth ting , mr james tien , mrs selina chow , mr cheung man - kwong , mrs sophie leung , mr sin chung - kai , mr howard young , mr lau wong - fat , mrs miriam lau , mr law chi - kwong , mr tommy cheung and mr michael mak voted for the amendment . dr raymond ho , mr eric li , dr lui ming - wah , miss margaret ng , mr bernard chan , mr abraham shek , miss li fung - ying and dr lo wing - lok voted against the amendment . mr hui cheung - ching , mr chan kwok - keung , mr wong yung - kan , mr timothy fok , mr henry wu , mr ip kwok - him and mr lau ping - cheung abstained . geographical constituencies and election committee : mr albert ho , mr lee cheuk - yan , mr martin lee , mr fred li , mr james to , dr yeung sum , miss emily lau , mr andrew cheng , mr szeto wah , mr albert chan and mr wong sing - chi voted for the amendment . mr ng leung - sing and prof ng ching - fai voted against the amendment . mr chan kam - lam , mr jasper tsang , mr lau kong - wah , miss choy so - yuk , mr tam yiu - chung , dr tang siu - tong , ms audrey eu , mr yeung yiu - chung and mr ambrose lau abstained . the president , mrs rita fan , did not cast any vote . the president announced that among the members returned by functional constituencies , 27 were present , 12 were in favour of the amendment , eight against it and seven abstained ; while among the members returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections and by the election committee , 23 were present , 11 were in favour of the amendment , two against it and nine abstained . since the question was not agreed by a majority of each of the two groups of members present , she therefore declared that the amendment was negatived . president : dr tang siu - tong , you may now reply . you have six minutes five seconds . dr tang siu - tong : madam president , first of all , i wish to thank the 15 members who spoke on this motion . all members who spoke on the motion consider that in the area of flood prevention , the government does leave much to be desired and there is the need for improvement . this is especially so with regard to its ineffective monitoring over flood prevention works , a factor leading to flooding affecting parts of hong kong , and becoming a huge laughing stock . all these are not expected by members . it is hoped that the government , after losing a sheep , can mend the fold by making immediate improvement to its monitoring measures , comprehensively reviewing flood prevention works , and putting forward other remedial measures . i am very pleased that the secretary for works has positively responded to members ' views concerning flood prevention works . according to him , a task force will be set up to enhance site supervision , improve water flow of river courses and foster contact with residents . it is hoped that hong kong people can soon be freed from the threat of flooding . however , as we all can see , a storm is coming tonight . all i hope is that nothing serious will happen tonight or tomorrow morning . as noted by mr lau kong - wah earlier on , if helicopters and rubber boats are again used in rescue operations tonight , then the flood prevention works may really be far from satisfactory . i again sincerely thank fellow members for speaking on this motion . thank you . president : i now put the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by dr tang siu - tong be passed . will those in favour please raise their hands ? ( members raised their hands ) president : those against please raise their hands . ( no hands raised ) president : i think the question is agreed by a majority respectively of each of the two groups of members , that is , those returned by functional constituencies and those returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections and by the election committee , who are present . i declare the motion passed . next meeting president : i now adjourn the council until 9 am - i repeat , 9am - on wednesday , 11 july 2001 . adjourned accordingly at twenty - seven minutes past six o'clock .

secretary for the treasury : president , we fully appreciate the expectations of members and the public on the civil service . we have always endeavoured to ensure high efficiency and optimal cost - effectiveness in all aspects of our operation . provision of transport support to bureaux and departments for the efficient discharge of their functions is no exception . we do not condone extravagance and wastefulness in the use of public funds . there are at present around 173 large saloon cars in the government . fourteen of them are used for conveyance of visiting heads of state and government , the chief executive , the chief justice , the chief secretary for administration , the financial secretary and the secretary for justice . the rest is allocated to policy bureaux , departments and the judiciary for conveyance of officers to meetings and official duties outside their places of work . they are also used from time to time for conveyance of non-officials and visiting vips on official business with the government . where vehicles are available , they may also be used in limited and prescribed circumstances for other permitted use by designated directorate and judiciary officers . it is worthy to note that these vehicles are not allocated for the exclusive use of policy secretaries , judicial officers or heads of departments ; operational requirements take precedence . we have taken on board the recommendations of the public accounts committee in its report no . 30 on the procurement of saloon cars , including the recommendation that we should pay due regard to economy in the selection of government vehicles . we will continue to exercise vigilence in procurement of vehicles to ensure best value - for - money , having regard to operational needs and due economy . mr david chu : madam president , senior civil servants used toyota vehicles in the past , but they are now using high - class luxurious vehicles from germany . would the use of these luxurious vehicles by civil servants affect their very outstanding , frugal and financially prudent image ? secretary for the treasury : madam president , i would like to thank mr chu for asking the supplementary question . i have already stated in my main reply that vehicles are not allocated for the exclusive use of individual civil servants and government vehicles are mainly allocated for the use of the whole bureau or department . as members of their respective departments , policy secretaries and heads of department can certainly use these vehicles . the type of vehicles by the government is strictly based on the tender requirements we set and the types of vehicles provided by the bidders for the government 's consideration . looking back at the past five to 10 years , i can tell members the types of large saloon cars we procured - madam president , i seek your leave to state the following in english - the vehicles included lexus ls400 , nissan cima , toyota crown , bmw , jaguar and mercedes - benz . actually , we did not specify before putting up each tender which type of vehicle we wished to procure and we strictly considered which bid was the most cost - effective on the basis of the requirements set . i know that the public accounts committee , members and the public have given the government a lot of invaluable advice on cost - effectiveness . a tendering exercise is now taking place and we have made reference to the views of the public accounts committee as stated in its report no . 30 . for instance , the adjustment of the ratio of prices in the whole assessment from 80% in the past to 50%. we have also accepted the request of the public accounts committee to categorize the items in the bid into two , namely mandatory requirements that bidders must comply with and desirable requirements that we find desirable but bidders do not necessarily need to comply with . through such measures , we wish to increase the cost - effectiveness in the procurement of vehicles by the government . mr hui cheung - ching : madam president , does the government have made any arrangements in its policy for officials of different ranks to use vehicles of different specifications ? can officials who have the right to enjoy the use of vehicles choose to use vehicles that are inferior to the specifications of the vehicles for their ranks ? secretary for the treasury : madam president , i would like to thank mr hui for asking the supplementary question . i have to reiterate that vehicles are not allocated for the exclusive use of individual civil servants . apart from the chief executive , the chief justice and some policy secretaries i just mentioned , all government vehicles are allocated for use by policy bureaux , courts and various departments . since policy bureaux , the judiciary and departments are units of different ranking , they are allocated government vehicles of different levels . so , policy bureaux and the judiciary are mainly allocated large saloon cars while departments are allocated two main types of vehicles , namely large saloon cars and medium saloon cars . our current practice is what i have already explained to members a minute ago . the second part of mr hui 's supplementary question concerns whether heads of department or civil servants can choose other types of government vehicles . in the use of government vehicles by civil servants , our consideration is mainly on a few factors . firstly , the civil servants concerned must use government vehicles for an official purpose . within a specified scope , if government vehicles are available , they can be used for conveyance of heads of department to and from their offices . however , civil servants who are on official duties would certainly have priority to use government vehicles . every department must first find out if the allocated vehicles are available , if so , it should use the department 's vehicles first . if a department fails to book its vehicles for use , as we have a pool car centre , it can book other vehicles at the pool car centre in case other colleagues have used the department 's vehicles for official duties . these are the existing rules for the use of vehicles . mr michael mak : madam president , the standard of luxuriousness of vehicles is one way to reflect the extravagance and sophistication of officials , but i think that the registration number of the cars is also very important . would the government consider giving up the no .1 car registration number that is not preceded by letters and putting it up for auction ? president : mr michael mak , the subject matter of this question is related to government vehicles but your supplementary question is about car registration number . can you try your best to connect your supplementary question and the subject matter of this question ? ( laughter ) mr michael mak : madam president , every vehicle has a registration number , for instance , there are ties between such letters as cs and sj showing on the number plates and the vehicles . i wonder why car registration number cannot be associated with the luxurious standard of vehicles . i hope that madam president would also think that this supplementary question is connected with the subject matter of this question . president : mr michael mak , i am very sorry and i know that you have tried your best to explain it , ( laughter ) but i suggest that you could raise another question to find out more from the secretary in future . mr ambrose lau : madam president , the secretary has stated in her main reply that they would pay due regard to economy to ensure best value - for - money in the procurement of vehicles . can the secretary , based on experience , tell us how long on average would a large saloon car be used by the government before its replacement ? secretary for the treasury : madam president , i would like to thank mr lau for asking the supplementary question . i can hardly provide an average number , but if i were to make a very rough assessment , i can only say that the government vehicles can last for six to seven years . why did i have such reservations in answering this supplementary question ? it is because , under our existing system , we do not decide to have the vehicles replaced purely on the basis of the age of the vehicles but on the condition of each individual vehicle . our colleagues in the electrical and mechanical services department would calculate all the expenses spent on each vehicle . for instance , they would calculate the servicing expenses to be spent on a vehicle that may have to be serviced frequently if we continue to use it . we also need to provide a supplementary vehicle for use by the relevant department during the servicing period . at present , no longer would we base on the age of a vehicle to decide across the board whether or not any vehicle should be replaced . i hope mr lau would understand that it was very brave of me to make a rough assessment that government vehicles are used for six to seven years because now we would decide whether or not a vehicle should be replaced on the basis of its condition . mr fred li : madam president , the secretary has stated in the third paragraph of her main reply that they would pay due regard to economy in the selection of government vehicles . my supplementary question is that if the government adopts this principle , why are officials at the level of bureau secretaries using bmw 7 series large saloon cars while d6 grade directorate officers are using mazda 929 vehicles ? why is there such an obvious difference ? would the status and identity of officials be one of the principles considered ? secretary for the treasury : madam president , i would like to thank mr li for asking this supplementary question because he has given me the chance to state for the fourth time that government vehicles are allocated for use by policy bureaux , departments and the judiciary and not for individual civil servants , with the exception of the chief executive , the three secretaries and the chief justice . policy bureaux , departments and the judiciary are at different rankings within the whole government structure and we have based on the different levels of these units to determine the types of government vehicles that should be allocated to the units at each level . does it mean that policy bureaux and the judiciary must use bmw7 series vehicles while departments must use toyota vehicles and so on ? they merely depend on the result of each tender exercise and the bid that succeeded . when i answered one of the supplementary questions , i have said in passing that a tender exercise is now taking place and the deadline for the tender exercise will be the middle of this month . we do not know which types of vehicles we would procure yet , and we have to assess and vet the bids collected before deciding on the types of government vehicles to be procured this time . mr fred li : madam president , the secretary has not answered the part of my question concerning due regard to economy . the secretary has indicated in her reply that different types of vehicles would be allocated to units at different levels . does that mean that the identity and status of officials would be considered ? the secretary has not made this point clear . concerning due regard to economy , why were those two types of vehicles with distinctly different degrees of luxury selected ? i hope the secretary could give an explicit reply . president : secretary , do you have anything to add ? secretary for the treasury : madam president , when we consider cost - effectiveness , apart from taking into account the prices stated on the bids , we would also take into account fuel consumption by the vehicles , the maintenance expenses of the vehicles and the maintenance period . concerning the series of saloon cars owned by the government , we have made our decision regarding the allocation of these saloon cars on the basis of the levels of the relevant units in the entire government structure . president : this council has spent more than 17 minutes on this question . although a few members are still queuing up to raise their questions , i can only permit one of them to ask the last supplementary question . mr howard young : madam president , the secretary said that in procurement of vehicles , the government would ensure the best value - for - money , having regard to due economy . and she just said that fuel consumption would also be taken into account . i would like to ask whether other factors , less tangible ones , such as emission standards which affect pollution , and the normal durability or life span of a car , can be quantified and taken into account as well when assessing whether it is value - for - money ? secretary for the treasury : president , all the factors which the honourable howard young have just mentioned will be taken into account in the assessment of the tender exercise now taking place . president : second question . illegal workers working in construction sites with forged green cards 2. mr chan kwok - keung : madam president , at present , proprietors in the construction industry may employ only workers holding valid certificates ( commonly known as " green cards " ) certifying their attendance at recognized safety training courses for carrying out the related work . it has been reported that some law - breakers arrange for mainlanders to come and work illegally at construction sites in hong kong and provide them with forged green cards . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the number of illegal workers arrested at construction sites since last january and , among them , the number of those who were found holding forged green cards and the number of illegal workers who were convicted ; ( b ) whether it will consider enhancing the security design of the green cards ; and ( c ) whether it regularly organizes activities to teach proprietors how to distinguish authentic green cards from forged ones ; if so , of the details ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , ( a ) from january 2000 to 30 april 2001 , a total of 450 suspected illegal workers were arrested by the immigration department and the hong kong police force during their joint operations at construction sites . of the 294 suspected illegal workers already prosecuted by the immigration department , 275 have been convicted . under the factories and industrial undertakings ( amendment ) ordinance 1999 , which came into effect on 1 may 2001 , all construction workers must have attended recognized safety training courses and carry with them green cards . as at the end of may , the labour department ( ld ) has not seized any forged green cards during its inspections . we are , however , very concerned about the reported use of forged green cards . the ld will pay particular attention to the authenticity of green cards in its future inspections . ( b ) we have reasons to believe that those who use forged green cards are mostly illegal workers . this is because a worker may be issued a green card on the same day after completing a one - day basic safety training course and passing a test . it is unnecessary for local workers to use forged green cards for working at construction sites . in fact , over 350000 green cards have so far been issued to construction workers . the purpose of issuing green cards to construction workers is to certify the holders ' completion of the safety training required in law . to prevent untrained persons from working at construction sites by way of forged green cards , the ld will liaise with various training providers on the feasibility and cost - effectiveness of introducing anti-forgery designs to green cards . indeed , if proprietors increase their vigilance in refraining from hiring illegal workers , the problem of forged green cards could be eliminated . ( c ) before the implementation of the legislation regarding green cards , the ld has written to employers ' associations in april this year urging them to remind members to be vigilant against the possible emergence of forged green cards . the ld has also written to authorized training providers requesting them to provide assistance to proprietors or contractors in verifying the authenticity of the green cards where necessary . holders of forged green cards are mostly illegal workers . to employ illegal workers is a very serious offence , and the offender shall be liable on conviction to a maximum penalty of a fine of $350,000 and three years ' imprisonment . before offering employment to workers , proprietors in the construction industry should scrutinize carefully if the workers possess valid identity cards and other necessary documents . if they are in doubt , they should immediately seek assistance from relevant government departments and training providers . as the use of the green cards has become more commonplace , employers and employees should be more familiar with it . at present we have no plans to organize regular activities to teach proprietors how to distinguish authentic green cards from forged ones . relevant government departments will , however , in the course of their day - to - day publicity and inspection work , continue to remind proprietors to be vigilant against illegal workers and the appropriate actions to take . mr chan kwok - keung : madam president , i do not know whether it is because the government has really failed to find any forged green cards or because the cards look almost the same as authentic ones that makes detection so difficult . will the government issue guidelines on green cards for labour inspectors to follow when carrying out inspections ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , the design of green cards is actually very simple . insofar as the current design is concerned , it is not difficult at all to forge a green card . however , a green card contains some information and a reference number . if an employer suspects forgery , he may call the relevant training provider to verify if the cardholder has received training against the reference number printed on the card , thereby ascertaining the authenticity of the card . furthermore , each green card bears the chop of the issuing authority and the card issuer . although labour inspectors are aware of the basic information contained in green cards , it is not easy for them to distinguish authentic green cards from forged ones immediately on the spot . however , they may , by virtue of their experience , judge whether or not the workers being inspected are illegal workers . such clues as timid behaviour of the workers or a particular dialect with which they speak will help labour inspectors to decide whether it is necessary to seek assistance from training providers for verification . from 2 may to 7 may , staff from the ld have inspected various construction sites and conducted random checks on the green cards held by more than 400 workers . no forged cards were detected . miss li fung - ying : madam president , in the second paragraph of part ( c ) of the main reply , the secretary mentioned that to employ illegal workers is a very serious offence . in part ( a ) of the main reply , the secretary also mentioned that 275 illegal workers have been convicted . will the secretary inform this council of the number of employers who have been prosecuted accordingly and of their convictions ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i do not have at hand information on the number of employers of these 200 - odd prosecuted workers . i will furnish a written reply some time later . ( annex i ) mr yeung yiu - chung : madam president , under the current system , employers or sub-contractors may allege that they cannot distinguish authentic green cards from forged ones and use this as a ground for defence and to avoid being punished . at the same time , the ld has not instructed employers how they can solve this problem either . will the secretary inform this council what the government will do to address this problem before the registration system is introduced ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , it is not true that the ld has not given any instruction to the employers , and basically , everyone knows what the green cards look like . we have no idea how closely the forged cards resemble the authentic ones . however , i believe employers are aware that they must step up their vigilance after receiving the letters from the ld . furthermore , we have provided employers with some channels for verification . if employers are in doubt , they should immediately call the relevant training providers for verification . mr andrew cheng : madam president , it is obvious from the main reply that the government is of the view that to employ illegal workers is a serious offence . nevertheless , it was mentioned in part ( a ) of the main reply that a total of 450 illegal workers were arrested in the first four months of this year . this shows that the problem of illegal workers does exist in the local construction industry and the problem is quite serious , coupled with the fact that " subcontracting " has been in existence in the industry for a long time . will the secretary inform this council of the measures to be taken by the government to tackle the key point raised in this question today against a background of illegal workers and " subcontracting " , or in other words , of the measures to be taken to prevent illegal workers from being employed to work at construction sites with the use of forged green cards ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i have to make a correction . what we are discussing at the moment is the number of illegal workers detected during the period from january 2000 to 30 april 2001 . during these 16 months , a total of 400 - odd suspected cases of illegal workers were detected . no prosecution and conviction have been taken with respect to some cases due to the lack of sufficient evidence . as a whole , the government has made a lot of efforts in addressing the problem of illegal workers . the most fundamental step taken by the immigration department is to make a lot of efforts in intercepting illegal immigrants . although two - way permit holders are not allowed to take up employment in hong kong , they are often found working on construction sites . they are most likely to hold forged green cards . in fact , in 1999 , the immigration ( amendment ) ordinance 1999 was enacted for the main purpose of combating the employment of illegal workers and , by virtue of the ordinance , both contractors and persons in charge of construction sites may be subject to penalty . since its commencement , the legislation has been able to produce a substantial deterring effect . the number of two - way permit holders coming to hong kong to work on construction sites has also seen a remarkable fall from 1415 in 1998 to 653 in 1999 , 267 in 2000 , and a mere 45 from january to april 2001 . in our opinion , the legislation has been able to produce a real deterrent effect . of course , we hope this problem can be eliminated . mr jasper tsang : madam president , the government has issued over 350000 green cards and used up a lot of resources . however , the secretary stated that it is unnecessary for local workers to forge green cards because all applications will be granted . in that case , is the action taken by the government unnecessary and will it lead to wastage of resources ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i do not get the full meaning of this supplementary question . ( laughter ) many people see the green cards as symbols of training as holders must have completed their safety training . for such cardholders , they are protected once they receive the cards . the fact that 358000 green cards have been issued means that 358000 people have received safety training , though all of them do not necessarily work at construction sites . as far as i remember , the former commissioner for labour , mr matthew cheung , was issued with a green card after attending a one - day course . notwithstanding the grant of government subsidy , attendants for such courses are required to pay a small amount of course fee . in my opinion , although the green cards are useful , it is not necessary for local workers to forge green cards in order to work at construction sites , because the charges for issuing the green cards and the course fees are low , abundant places are available , and the course only lasts for one day . there is simply no need for the workers to take the risk of forging the green cards . mr lau chin - shek : madam president , employers obviously do not know who should be punished if employees are found to possess forged green cards . i believe card - forging syndicates might have existed . what measures will the government take to ensure that this issue will be handled more fairly and a solution will be proposed to tackle the problem ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , to start with , we can only obtain clues to help us examine whether card - forging syndicates really exist when forged green cards are found , or when someone is arrested by the police or the immigration department for using a forged green card . however , as i said in the main reply , people using forged green cards are mostly illegal workers . we are unable to trace whether such syndicates are located in hong kong or the mainland unless forged green cards are found . so far , the ld has not formally seized or found any forged green cards during its inspection rounds . we were only told by the media that there was such a problem . miss chan yuen - han : madam president , the earlier remark made by the secretary that no forged green cards have been found as at the end of may has made me feel even more insecure , because in the actions taken jointly by the immigration department and the hong kong police force , 450 people were arrested in 16 months for working illegally at construction sites , and yet no relevant figures have been reported by the ld in may for nil discoveries . this is probably one of the reasons which made people worry as cited by this council and some newspapers . will the secretary inform this council whether such a situation is caused by the fact that there are some problems with the standard of inspections carried out by the ld ? why is it possible for the hong kong police force and the immigration department to have arrested 450 illegal workers ? faced with the results of inspection carried out by different government departments , is the secretary concerned about the current standard of inspections carried out at construction sites by the ld ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i was referring to two different periods of time in the main reply . this is because the relevant legislation did not come into formal effect until 1 may whereas the 400 - odd illegal workers were arrested before the green cards came into effect . we hope the immigration department and the hong kong police force can , in addition to inspecting the identity papers of the workers , ask them to produce their green cards in the course of carrying out inspections at construction sites . i have absolutely no doubts about the ability of labour inspectors . i trust that they will carry out inspections in the same manner and refer the relevant cases to the immigration department if illegal workers are found at construction sites . miss chan yuen - han : madam president , the secretary has not answered my supplementary question . she was right in saying that she had referred to different government departments . in part ( a ) of the main reply , she mentioned that 400 - odd illegal workers were arrested by the immigration department and the hong kong police force as at april 2001 , though the ld has detected no illegal workers at construction sites in may . this is why i questioned whether there is any problem with the standard of law enforcement . the secretary has not answered this question . president : secretary for education and manpower , do you have anything to add ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i have answered the supplementary question put by the honourable member . actually , no data is available at the moment for comparison with the data obtained with respect to the police and the immigration department after may . if the honourable member is interested , we may follow up the issue in the meetings of the panel on manpower after a few months to see if any detection has been made by the immigration department and the police in carrying out inspections . president : we have spent 16 minutes on this oral question . this is the last supplementary question . mr lee cheuk - yan : madam president , the secretary stated earlier that no forged cards have been found at the moment . if such cards are found , investigations will be carried out to see if card - forging syndicates do really exist . actually , even if such forged cards are found , the government could not institute any prosecution for even though anyone employing illegal workers will be penalized , the current law does not impose any penalties with respect to the forging of green cards , is that correct ? secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i would like to answer this supplementary question after the meeting because i want to check what is actually laid down in the law . ( annex ii ) nevertheless , i am of the view that insofar as this issue is concerned , illegal workers constitute the main reason , while forged cards is only an auxiliary tool . i think we should refer the matter to the hong kong police force for investigation . i will consult the police to see if it is possible for the source to be traced . president : third question . provision of sufficient cultural , leisure and sports facilities in new towns 3. mr tam yiu - chung : madam president , it has been reported that there are signs of triad infiltration in schools in tung chung . regarding the provision of sufficient cultural , leisure and sports facilities to allow young people to actively participate in such activities and reduce the chances of their going astray , will the government inform this council whether it will : ( a ) speed up the construction of cultural , leisure and sports facilities , such as libraries , community halls and stadiums , and provide more open spaces in tung chung ; if so , of the details ; if not , the reasons for that ; ( b ) when developing new towns , consider the early construction of various cultural , leisure and sports facilities as well as open spaces ; and ( c ) consider drawing up a fast - track funding process for the construction of cultural , leisure and sports facilities , so as to avoid any delay caused by the need for them to compete with other construction projects for financial resources ? secretary for home affairs : madam president , my reply to mr tam yiu - chung 's question is as follows : (1) in planning the provision of district facilities in new towns , the leisure and cultural services department ( lcsd ) takes account of the population growth and the local demand for leisure and cultural services facilities . in the case of tung chung , its population is 21000 at present , and is expected to increase to 90000 by 2003 . by 2006 , its population will further increase to about 200000 . we have a number of leisure and cultural projects under active planning in order to meet the demand of residents in new towns for such facilities . our current focus is on developing an open space project in area 7 and an indoor recreation centre cum library project in area 17 of the town . for the latter project , we will also consider including community hall facilities in the project scope . (2) in planning and implementing new leisure and cultural projects , we have to follow a number of procedures aimed at ensuring the proper utilization of public resources . these include : ( a ) establishing the need for the projects , in terms of population growth , community demand , the readiness of the site , availability and utilization rate of similar facilities in the locality and cost - effectiveness of the project ; ( b ) finalizing the precise scope of the project ; ( c ) confirming that the project is technically feasible ; and ( d ) securing financial resources for the project . we recognize the need to provide leisure and cultural facilities in a timely manner to cope with the rapid population growth in new towns and other districts under development . we are making an effort and will do our utmost to meet this need . (3) as with other public capital works projects , the funding of leisure and cultural facilities is subject to established procedures aimed at ensuring the proper and timely use of public funds . the existing funding procedures for public works projects are formulated on the basis of long years of accumulated experience for compliance by all policy bureaux and departments . any attempt to fast - track the existing funding mechanism by jumping certain important steps would run the risk of greater delays in the longer term due to factors neglected in the initial planning process . nonetheless , we shall further examine the possibility of streamlining certain procedures , particularly in respect of smaller projects , such as district open space leisure facilities , which involve less complications . mr tam yiu - chung : madam president , in his reply to my main question , the secretary mentioned that the current focus is on developing areas 7 and 17 in tung chung . both projects are in category c . may i ask the government when will these projects commence and when will they be completed ? besides , regarding the open space projects in areas 1 and 15 in tung chung , and the project to build an indoor game centre in area 2 of the town , when will construction works commence ? secretary for home affairs : madam president , for the time being , we hope that the open space project in area 7 and the indoor recreation centre cum library project in area 17 , tung chung can be included in our funding applications under the resource allocation exercises in 2001 and 2002 respectively . as for the other facilities , we hope to seek funding for them within the parameters of the resource allocation exercise in the coming fiscal years . mr albert chan : madam president , when the government develops new towns , it is often the case that many recreational facilities ( including sports facilities ) have still yet to be completed some time after the intake of population . in tin shui wai , for example , its population now has reached 200000 but the library will only be completed in 2005-06 . the same is likely to happen in tung chung at any time . that is , the relevant recreational facilities will not be completed long after the intake of population . can the government tell us explicitly when will the library , indoor recreational centre and public swimming pool in tung chung be completed ? secretary for home affairs : madam president , we can set out the exact timetable for completion of the projects only after funding is sought through the resource allocation procedures and with the approval of the public works subcommittee of the legislative council . however , madam president , we do appreciate members ' concern over the provision of cultural , leisure and sports facilities in new towns . but i wish to point out that for some services , say , the library service , provisional service will be provided prior to the completion of a library project . for example , there are mobile libraries in the new town of tung chung , providing service for residents three times a month . some district facilities of a smaller scale are also available , and they are included in the design of public housing estates . it is encouraging to see that private housing developments generally attach great importance to recreational and sports facilities now . for instance , a large private housing estate in tung chung is well - equipped with leisure facilities which can provide its residents with the relevant recreational activities . but anyhow , madam president , i can assure members that the lcsd is very concerned about whether these projects can be completed as scheduled , and i will endeavour to seek the requisite resources through the resource allocation procedures . prof ng ching - fai : madam president , the secretary 's earlier reply mostly revolves around hardware facilities , but it is inadequate to rely solely on hardware facilities to resolve effectively the problem of triad infiltration in schools . will the secretary tell us if the home affairs bureau or any other policy bureau has plans to provide cultural , leisure and sports activities for the town , particularly as the hardware facilities have not yet been fully available for use ? what arrangements will the authorities make , say , for the forthcoming summer holiday ? secretary for home affairs : madam president , we certainly cannot rely on the provision of passive cultural , leisure and sports facilities alone to tackle the problem of triad harassment in schools . in fact , many policy bureaux have provided a myriad of healthy activities for students . for instance , on education front , apart from the extra curricular activities provided by schools , the quality education fund also provides considerable resources for schools and educators to organize healthy activities for students . moreover , the home affairs department ( had ) organizes an extensive summer youth programme every year during the summer holidays . the accumulated number of participants in the programme in recent years has exceeded 1 million , showing its popularity among youngsters . in addition , even if the hardware facilities cannot be made available in time , the lcsd will provide various kinds of cultural , leisure and sports activities for youngsters in the light of the respective circumstances and environment in different districts . tung chung is basically easily accessible in terms of its transport facilities . there are railway and buses servicing the town , and it takes less than 30 minutes to reach the kwai ching district . as there are large - scale and well - established cultural , leisure and sports facilities in the kwai ching district , i believe they should be able to meet the demand of residents in tung chung to a certain extent . mr ip kwok - him : madam president , new towns are in fact a new development in the context of urban development , and they should have the set - ups ready before residents are allowed to move in . the secretary mentioned just now that remedial measures will be taken in the event of inadequate facilities . will the government tell us why , in designing new towns , the relevant facilities are not completed for use by residents in advance ? in designing new towns , the government should have projected the population to be accommodated in future . it should not be the case that the government has no idea about the speed of their development or what they are going to look like ultimately . under such circumstances , can the government set a basic requirement in respect of cultural , leisure and sports facilities and get prepared beforehand , so that it will be unnecessary to provide such services as mobile libraries ? can the government consider setting a basic requirement or standard for cultural , leisure and sports facilities in a community ? secretary for home affairs : madam president , currently we have based on the hong kong planning standards and guidelines in planning facilities for new towns . i think in developing new communities , not only hong kong but also countries all over the world will face a question that cannot be answered easily and that is , at what pace should these facilities be provided ? i think it is obviously most desirable to have all facilities prepared before the intake of population . but in reality , as we always have to compete for resources in all aspects , this ideal is very often not the best option in terms of cost - effectiveness . moreover , there are also problems in reality concerning the programme of works and site formation . therefore , despite prior planning efforts , sometimes the facilities can be completed only at a later stage . in view of this , there must be a certain degree of flexibility by sharing the facilities of neighbouring districts . in any case , the lcsd will seek adequate resources through the relevant procedures on the basis of the hong kong planning standards and guidelines as far as possible , with a view to providing adequate cultural , leisure and sports facilities for the new town of tung chung . miss cyd ho : madam president , in part ( b ) of the main reply the secretary replied in all sincerity that he would do his utmost to provide community recreational and cultural facilities at places with rapid population growth . in fact , the rate of population growth is already known : 21000 in 2001 , 90000 in 2003 , and it will further increase to 200000 by 2006 . such being the case , what criteria does the bureau adopt for deciding when to start planning for the community facilities ? the current situation is that there is no synchronized provision of facilities . but with early planning , we should be able to provide them in synchronization with the intake of population , particularly as the government well knows that the population will reach 200000 by 2006 . will the secretary inform this council whether the government aims to synchronize the provision of facilities with the intake of population or to do its utmost to embark on planning only after all residents have moved in ? secretary for home affairs : madam president , we have many years of experience in the development of new towns . very often , owing to various factors , such as the timetable for the completion of public housing or market - oriented adjustments made to development sites by private developers , the actual rate of population growth will not be entirely the same as our projection . therefore , apart from the lcsd , all departments responsible for providing supplementary facilities , and even the education department tasked with the provision of facilities as important as schools , often have to adjust the programme of the relevant works projects in the light of the actual circumstances . besides , the need to bid for resources from the central government is another factor . i can say that for a long time , it has generally not been a big problem to bid for resources for public facilities , for we currently have rather abundant resources for non-recurrent expenditure . but if non - recurrent expenditure will lead to a growth in recurrent expenditure in future , then i will have to fight for resources for recurrent expenditure , and this would actually be subject to the overall economic environment . therefore , for all bureaux and departments , not just the hab or the had , theoretically they are required to provide facilities in the light of population growth . every bureau and department will plan in advance , and it is not the case that they start planning only after residents have moved in . that said , there will always be variations in respect of the actual date of completion , for it depends on a diversity of objective factors , including the overall economic environment , budgetary conditions , progress of public works , capacity of the construction industry , and so on . in the long run , however , the overall development of new towns and progress of matching projects are generally well co-ordinated , albeit occasional slippage . dr tang siu - tong : madam president , in part ( c ) of the main reply the secretary said that the funding of these facilities is subject to established procedures , and that any attempt to fast - track the existing funding mechanism would run the risk of delays in the longer term due to factors neglected in the initial planning process . since the procedures have been observed , what factors would have been neglected and hence resulted in the subsequent delays ? has the government any solution to enable these projects to get started earlier ? secretary for home affairs : madam president , perhaps let me explain it briefly . drawing lessons from past experience , we are convinced that in the current public works procedures , the completion of some procedures is compulsory . they include a feasibility study of each project . this study is introduced only in recent years . it is because for projects upgraded from category c to category b which had been considered feasible in their initial detailed design , they were often found to be not feasible in actual implementation after funding had been sought . as a result , many projects , including projects in category a , have remained outstanding even after long delays . from past experience , a feasibility study must be conducted for each project prior to its implementation . the work involved in the initial stage is often more time - consuming , and it is generally not a big problem to secure funding for the project . this is a good experience because after the introduction of the project feasibility study , indeed we have seen less cases of extensive delays occurred after funding was sought and the project got started , unless problems such as the contractor having gone bankrupt , and so on , are involved . therefore , the government holds that these procedures must be preserved . we cannot conduct studies hastily and wind things up frivolously only to enable the projects to get started soon . in the event of any delay caused , the losses will outweigh the gains . president : we have spent over 18 minutes on this question . we now proceed to the fourth question . list of shortfall posts for professionals in information technology and financial services sectors 4 . mr leung fu - wah : madam president , it has been reported that a list of shortfall posts for professionals in the information technology and financial services sectors has been drawn up in order to speed up the vetting of applications made under the admission of mainland professionals scheme ( amps ) . in this connection , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the details of the list ; ( b ) the criteria adopted for drawing up the list ; and ( c ) the organizations and persons it has consulted before drawing up the list ? secretary for security : madam president , the amps was implemented on 1 june , and details of the application procedures were announced by the immigration department ( immd ) on 18 may . at present , the amps only applies to the information technology and financial services sectors . members asked on several occasions about the future manpower requirement and shortage in these two sectors , as well as the occupation categories which will face manpower shortage when the administration introduced the amps to the relevant panels of the legislative council over the past months . the government of the special administrative region provided the required statistics ( including information on occupation categories which will face manpower shortage ) to the legislative council on 28 march . members have discussed the relevant information . the government does not have a list of shortfall posts as referred to by mr leung fu - wah . we make reference to the estimated figures on manpower growth and shortage stated in the report on manpower projection to 2005 and the consultancy study on manpower and training needs of the information technology sector published by the education and manpower bureau ( emb ) last year . we also pay regard to the following reference information on broad occupation categories : ( a ) the manpower requirement of various skill categories between 2000 and 2004 as set out in the manpower survey report 2000 published by the committee on information technology training and development under the vocational training council . the report covers survey response from 1 493 companies ; and ( b ) information on occupation categories with serious manpower shortage arising from relevant policy bureaux 's consultation with organizations and representatives of the information technology sector as well as financial market participants . manpower shortage in the information technology sector is found in the occupation categories of information technology management , application systems development , telecommunications and networking , information technology education and training , and so on . as regards the financial services sector , the shortfall occurs in the occupation categories of trade and project finance , economic analysis , capital raising and investment services , risk management , actuarial services , and so on . since the relevant information has been set out in our submission on 28 march ( which is the annex to the main reply ) , i will not repeat each and every detail here . in vetting applications made by the professionals , the immd will make reference to the above information so as to have an initial idea of whether the posts concerned face a serious shortage of manpower . i must , however , stress that each application will be assessed independently , based on the background and job requirements of the applicant . as it is impossible to produce an exhaustive list of each and every post in short supply , coupled with the fact that market demand may fluctuate from time to time , the information will only be used for reference purpose . there is no question that the normal vetting procedure can be bypassed even if the post applied for matches the general information on job categories with shortfall . the immd will process all applications in a fair and equitable manner , and will consult relevant departments and organizations where necessary to ascertain whether there are difficulties in recruiting local professionals to fill the posts concerned . mr leung fu - wah : madam president , the secretary mentions in the third paragraph of her main reply that the government does not have a list of shortfall posts , yet she also points out in part ( a ) of the paragraph that a survey covering 1493 companies has been conducted . from this we can infer that those 1000 - odd companies should have reflected the manpower shortage situation . since the secretary says the government does not have a list of shortfall posts , may i ask her what her rationale is in saying so ? secretary for security : madam president , i guess the honourable leung fu - wah is influenced by a press report to raise this supplementary question , as the report claims that the government has drawn up a list of shortfall posts . but the fact is that we do not have such a list , we have only consulted some relevant material , including the detailed report published by the committee on information technology training and development under the vocational training council that mr leung referred to just now . the report sets out the manpower requirement of various skill categories between 2000 and 2004 and covers survey response from 1 493 companies . as i point out in the main reply , we have also paid regard to other information , such as that prepared by relevant policy bureaux upon consultation with the industries concerned . so , we do have some reference material , but we do not have a list of shortfall posts as referred to by mr leung . mr albert ho : madam president , the relevant panels of the council have also read the part of the report on manpower projection to 2005 relating to the financial services sector . however , we noticed that there was not any figure in the report pointing to the sector that has any manpower shortage problem - i stress that there is no figure or data in this respect , the report only broadly criticized the students of hong kong as being less competitive in such aspects as language ability , communication skills , leadership , field of vision , and so on . if we infer from such broad comments that employers are having much difficulties recruiting suitable personnel to take up posts in the relevant industries , how is the immd going to vet applications in the light of these broad standards ? basing on this report , we may almost be sure that all applications will be approved because the students of hong kong are not competitive enough . with regard to the manpower shortage situation inferred from the broad comments made in the report , could the secretary inform this council whether the government has any objective criteria for vetting the applications ? president : which secretary will answer this supplementary question ? secretary for security . secretary for security : madam president , mr albert ho is right in saying that the emb has not set out any specific manpower shortage figures in the report it published . but then , basing on the information contained in the report , the emb has further inferred that by 2005 , the estimated number of managers , executives , professionals and associate professionals required to fill vacancies in banks , insurance companies and other financial services institutions might amount to 16 800 . besides , we have also consulted the financial services bureau and learnt that according to members of the financial markets , manpower shortage would mainly be found in the occupation categories of trade and project finance , economic analysis , capital raising and investment services , risk management , insurance services training , actuarial services , and so on . madam president , these data are for reference only . in addition to making reference to the information on hand upon receiving an application , during the vetting process the immd will also consult relevant policy bureaux like the financial services bureau or other relevant organizations to see if a certain post ( for example , actuary ) really faces a shortage of manpower , before it considers whether or not to approve the application concerned . mr albert ho : madam president , the secretary 's reply does not seem to answer my supplementary question . my point is that if the report only broadly mentions that there is a shortage of manpower because the standards of the tertiary institution students in hong kong are below par , how can the secretary formulate any criteria for vetting the applications ? if the standards of local students should be below par as pointed out in the report , then almost all applications would be approved . should that be the case , could the government really formulate any criteria for vetting the applications ? in other words , any applicants can come and work here , as their applications will certainly be approved . president : secretary , do you have anything to add ? secretary for security : madam president , actually we have mentioned it many times that regardless of whether the applicants are from the mainland or overseas , our criterion for approving applications for work permits has all along been the same and that is , the applicants must have expertise that cannot be available locally in hong kong . it is our standing practice to require employers to provide evidence that they have tried , but without success , to recruit local talents to fill the posts concerned . we also adopt the same practice when vetting applications for admitting professionals from the mainland . for example , if a certain company needs to recruit an actuary from the mainland , in addition to consulting the relevant policy bureaux or members of the trade to see if there is indeed a shortage of manpower , we will also ask the company concerned whether it has really made an effort to recruit talents locally . the company is required to make this declaration in its application form . under the immigration ordinance , any company giving false information to the director of immigration is liable to a criminal offence . if the immd should have any suspicion regarding the declarations made in the application form , before accepting the application concerned , the department could certainly ask the company concerned to come and make clear whether it has any evidence proving that it did have make an attempt to recruit talents locally , such as placing recruitment advertisements or making inquiries to the labour department about the availability of local talents in the field . any company making an application may be prosecuted if the immd has reasonable grounds to believe that it has given any false information . dr lui ming - wah : madam president , while the present amps is applicable to only the information technology and financial services sectors , we know that professionals in different field are in actual need in society . i do not understand why the government only confines the amps to these two sectors . companies and firms in other sectors also have needs for professionals , why can they not be allowed to recruit professionals from outside hong kong ? could the secretary inform this council of the government 's rationale behind this policy ? secretary for security : madam president , i have already mentioned the reason when answering the supplementary question raised by mr albert ho just now . traditionally speaking , persons admitted to hong kong from elsewhere must meet the prerequisite that the experience , skills or knowledge they possess must be useful to and lacking in hong kong . when considering relaxing the restrictions on admission of mainland professionals to take up employment in hong kong , the information on hand , which includes the various reports i mentioned earlier on , has already provided with enough evidence that the information technology and financial services sectors are currently faced with a shortage of manpower . as regards the question of whether other sectors are also faced with similar problems , we will consider it when reviewing the amps . miss choy so - yuk : madam president , i am more concerned about the number of persons willing to participate in the amps . could the secretary inform this council of the general response to the amps as at 1 june ; or , in other words , the number of mainland professionals willing to participate in the amps ? secretary for security : madam president , 1 june was last friday , which was just a few working days earlier . the response to the amps is as follows : we have so far distributed 7000 - odd pamphlets and 2000 - odd application forms and received a total of nine properly completed applications , of which five were from the information technology sector and four from the financial services sectors . mr chan kwok - keung : madam president , according to the secretary 's main reply , the administration will consult relevant departments and organizations of the trade in respect of certain applications . may i ask the secretary what did she mean by relevant organizations ? could the secretary also inform this council whether relevant trade unions or associations are also included ; and if not , could they be included as well ? secretary for security : madam president , i thank mr chan kwok - keung for his supplementary question and i am glad to have this opportunity to clarify the standing practice of the immd . the organizations the immd consults are comparatively more objective and independent , and have a more comprehensive supply of information , including the emb ( to find out which industries are faced with a shortage of manpower ) , labour department , census and statistics department , as well as vocational training council . where necessary , the immd will also consult members of the sectors concerned through relevant policy bureaux ( such as the financial services bureau ) . mr ambrose lau : madam president , at the end of her main reply the secretary mentions that the immd " will consult relevant departments and organizations where necessary to ascertain whether there are difficulties in recruiting local professionals to fill the posts concerned " . in this connection , may i ask the secretary what does " where necessary " mean ? could the secretary provide this council with a detailed explanation ? secretary for security : madam president , what i mean is that in some cases the posts involved are rather uncommon , there are even some which the immd has never heard of before . for such posts , which are very much unlike actuary or information system manager , it is not possible to ascertain whether there is really a shortage of manpower just by making reference to the information provided by the labour department or the census and statistics department . in dealing with applications of this kind , the immd will consult the relevant government departments where necessary . in the event that the shipping sector is involved , for example , the immd may need to consult the policy bureaux responsible for shipping matters , the marine department , and so on . the immd may also consult members of the sector via these bureaux and departments such the need arises . but then again , cases of this kind are rather rare . miss chan yuen - han : madam president , according to the secretary 's reply to the main question asked by mr leung fu - wah , the government consulted the information technology sector through the relevant policy bureaux . besides , in answering the supplementary raised by mr chan kwok - keung just now , the secretary further mentioned that relevant organizations would also be consulted . for occupation categories in both the information technology sector and the financial services sector alike , the administration will consult only the relevant companies and policy bureaux . that being the case , may i ask the secretary whether the government feels that the information collected this way is unbalanced , in that a part of the consultation process , which is the consultation structure comprising members of relevant trade unions , is missing ? secretary for security : madam president , the aim of the immd is to draw on some comparatively objective information to ascertain whether there is really a shortage of manpower in the market . the measure adopted by the department has been in operation for several decades and proven effective . there is no question of too many or too few applications being approved each year ; the successful applications can largely cater for the needs of the market . we therefore consider the existing mode of operation sufficient . miss chan yuen - han : madam president , the secretary has not answered my supplementary . just now i said the government consulted only the relevant companies or operators of the two sectors without paying regard to the views of trade unions formed by the employees concerned . i asked the secretary whether she considered the information collected this way unbalanced , but she did not answer my question . secretary for security : madam president , actually , we do not consult the companies concerned . if there should be a shortage of planning managers in the shipping sector , for example , some companies would apply for admission of professionals from outside hong kong to fill the posts . upon receiving such applications , we will consult the labour department and the census and statistics department to ascertain whether the posts concerned really face a shortage of manpower . we may also need to learn more about the mode of operation of the industry . in that case we will have to consult the economic services bureau or consult members of the industry through the bureau . we consider it is most important to ascertain objectively whether certain posts really face a shortage of manpower . we do not think the information collected is unbalanced just because we do not actively solicit views from trade unions . president : last supplementary question . mr lee cheuk - yan : madam president , we read in the newspapers that in vetting applications for admitting professionals the immd would refer to a set of wage level indicators - i believe the wage level indicators are provided objectively by the census and statistics department . may i ask the secretary whether it is the government 's existing policy to reject all applications offering wages below the relevant indicators ? secretary for security : madam president , this should be true under normal circumstances . unless in very exceptional cases , applications offering wage levels lower than the indicators concerned should not be approved . president : fifth question . progress of rolling out of wireline - based local fixed telecommunications networks 5 . mr chan kam - lam : madam president , three new wireline - based local fixed telecommunications network services operators ( new ftns operators ) have signed deeds of undertakings with the government to commit themselves to certain capital investment and network coverage by the end of 2002 . the administration has anticipated that more than 50% of the residential line customers should have at least one additional choice of the services provided by new ftns operators by that time . in this regard , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the respective network coverage of these new ftns operators in public housing estates ( pres ) , private residential premises and commercial premises in each district at present , and how these figures compare with their commitments made to the government ; ( b ) of the estimated percentage of pres which will have been provided with new networks by the end of 2002 ; and ( c ) whether it plans to assist new ftns operators in expediting the rolling out of their networks ; if it has , of the details ; if it has not , how it will ensure real competition in the ftns market and the safeguards for customer rights and benefits ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , i will answer the three parts of the question seriatim . ( a ) the commitments regarding the extension of network and services coverage made by the three new ftns operators , namely hutchison global crossing limited ( hgc ) , new t & t hong kong limited ( new t & t ) and new world telephone limited ( nwt ) to the government cover : ( i ) network coverage through " type ii interconnection " to the local exchanges of pccw - hkt ( that is , interconnection by the new ftns operators to the local loops of pccw - hkt such that the former can provide service to its customers using the local loops of the latter ) ; ( ii ) provision of direct access to buildings ; and ( iii ) a minimum capital investment for the rollout of telecommunications network and service . in addition to the commitments for 2002 , the new ftns operators have also laid down the interim milestones for the years 2000 and 2001 . the commitments are set out at the annex . all the operators have met the respective interim milestones made for 2000 except hgc , which have not completed the type ii interconnection in three local exchanges such that the interim milestone in commitment ( i ) above have not been attained . some operators have rolled out beyond the initial commitments . the telecommunications authority ( ta ) has already requested hgc to take reasonable actions or remedies to fulfill the set target . given that the milestones are not separately measured on the basis of network coverage in pres , private residential premises and commercial premises , it is difficult to make any comparisons . however , it is stipulated in the licence conditions ( that is , gc 10 (2) ) that if an ftns operator has access to the telephone exchange of a region or has direct connection to a particular building , it should provide services to customers of that region or occupants of that building . also , it cannot refuse to provide services to customers of individual buildings ( for example , pres ) , otherwise it will have violated the licence conditions . should infringements of the licence condition be found , the office of the telecommunications authority ( ofta ) could take disciplinary actions against the operators concerned in pursuant of the telecommunications ordinance by issuing instructions or imposing fines . having regard to the number of the telephone exchanges and premises connected by the three new ftns operators in 2000 , we estimate that currently more than 30% and 45% of residential line and commercial line customers respectively can choose to subscribe to the services provided by one of the three new operators . ( b ) as the commitments made by the new ftns operators are not based on the network coverage in pres or private premises , we are not in a position to estimate the percentage of pres that will be covered by new fixed network by the end of 2002 . however , considering the current progress of network coverage , we believe that by the end of 2002 , more than 50% of residential line customers will have an alternative choice of at least one of the three new ftns operators . ( c ) the ofta is committed to assisting new ftns operators in rolling out their networks so as to ensure effective competition and to protect consumers ' interest . specific measures include the following : ( i ) provide assistance to the three new ftns operators in overcoming difficulties in rolling out networks through type ii interconnection a working group was formed in late 1998 comprising the ofta , the hong kong telecom and the three new ftns operators . an " industry code of practice for the interconnection of local access link " was promulgated to resolve the problems encountered by the ftns operators in conducting type ii interconnection and to expedite action . the working group is convened frequently to discuss problems encountered in implementing the industry code of practice and to work out solutions . it also keeps under review relevant provisions in the code of practice . ( ii ) accelerate the establishment of " customer access network " to enable new ftns operators to lay telecommunications cables in buildings in view of the difficulties in laying telecommunications cables owing to limited space in buildings , the government has amended the buildings ordinance and its supplementary code of practice to provide adequate space and facilities for installing telecommunications cables in new buildings on a mandatory basis . the ofta has also set up a task force to co-ordinate arrangements of access to the buildings by ftns operators . to clarify the ftns operators ' rights of access to the buildings , the telecommunications ordinance was also amended in june 2000 to provide the ta solid legal grounds for making the relevant determinations . ( iii ) to enable the price of residential lines to be determined by economic principles for a long time , the price of residential lines was below their cost , and the residential line service was cross - subsidized by external telecommunications services , that is , idd . undoubtedly , this will have an adverse effect on the commercial incentives of new ftns operators to develop residential line service . with the liberalization of external telecommunications market , the cross - subsidization on local services from external services no longer exists . pccw - hkt has gradually increased the price of residential lines to cost level . the three new ftns operators no longer need to provide service at a price which is below cost . this provides the commercial incentive for the three new ftns operators to develop local telephone line services on an economic basis . annex network and services commitments made by the new ftns operators (1) expansion of network coverage through type ii interconnection lockhart , - a total of seven west , ngau tau kok , exchanges shau kei wan , [ wan chai ] telecom house , wan chai , note : exchanges in west [ ] were completed in advance of schedule . a total of 16 exchanges note : exchanges in [ ] were uncompleted . lockhart , - a total of eight telecom house , queen 's road , [ wan chai ] west , sha tin , shau kei wan , note : exchange in - a total of 12 tai po , [ ] was completed in exchanges telecom house , advance of schedule . wan chai , west a total of 18 exchanges hermes house , ngau tau lok , kwai chung , ngau tau kok , - a total of 10 tsing yi , shau kei wan , tsing yi , wan chai , west , yuen long - a total of 22 exchanges (2) specified number of buildings being committed to have direct access note : includes network coverage through type ii interconnection . (3) accumulated capital investment commitment as from 1 january 1999 ( in million hk dollars ) mr chan kam - lam : madam president , according to the information in the annex to the main reply of the secretary , before late 2000 , the new ftns operators have completed interconnection to the exchange at kwun tong in advance of schedule . the reply indicated the commitments made are not based on the network coverage in pres or private premises . given that 70% of the premises in kwun tong are pre units , will the secretary inform this council whether the three new ftns are laying telecommunication cables in kwun tong with a preference for private premises and ignoring pres ? do the authorities have any data for this ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , as i have explained a moment ago , the commitments made are not based on the network coverage in pres or private premises . so , we do not have such kind of data . mr wong sing - chi : madam president , from the information in the annex to the main reply , we can see that there are no new ftns operators to provide service in the north district or tuen mun district before late 2002 . how can the ta ensure that , in the commitments , there will still be a choice of ftns services for households in the districts excluded from such services ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , the figure 50% was an estimate obtained from the three ftns operators . ftns operators may roll out beyond the commitments . they may also extend their networks to other districts , such as the north district . of course , it all depends on their own commercial decisions . but we must not forget that other than exisitng ftns operators providing these voice services , there are also other licences issued by the government . for example , in early 2000 , among the six ftns licences issued , five were non - wireline - based ftns licences , under which operators may provide residential and commercial telephone services . we understand some operators are planning to provide the relevant services . in the 2000 policy address , we undertook to invite applications for new ftns licences in 2001 , that is , this year . there is a possibility that the new ftns operators may extend their market coverage to the areas mentioned by mr wong . furthermore , we have a very competitive mobile telephone service , which is also an extra choice for consumers . at present , the mobile telephone penetration rate in hong kong is already nearly 80%. miss emily lau : madam president , in her main reply , the secretary said the hgc has not completed the type ii interconnection in three local exchanges such that the interim milestones have not been attained and the ta has already requested the hgc to take appropriate actions . will the secretary inform this council whether there have been any investigations into the reasons for the failure ? what are the problems that the company is facing ? moreover , what were the responses when the ta discussed with the company ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , up to now , problems with one of the exchanges have been solved . for the second exchange , there has not been sufficient exchange capacity for cables , but the ofta is now taking active steps to assist the new ftns operator to find a place for the relevant facilities . it fails to complete the type ii interconnection exchange for the last exchange because there are insufficient telecommunications pipelines for the cables . at the moment , pccw - hkt is conducting a feasibility study on the problem . mr sin chung - kai : madam president , i would like to ask about price increases . from the present penetration rate , i do not think the situation will be too desirable in the next half year no matter how hard the government may try . will the government inform this council what benchmark it would use to consider the application for price increases to be made by the pccw - hkt in 2002 ? this is related to penetration rate , which is also an issue among mr chan kam - lam 's concerns . a high penetration rate means sufficient competition , in which case people have a choice . it is like buying a piece of soap . one may choose this one or that one . however , the present situation is that people do not have a choice or an alternative , even though they want to choose . when the people do not have sufficient choices and ftns operators apply for price increases , how will the government make a decision ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , first of all , i tend to disagree with what mr sin said about ftns operators failing to reach the commitments , because we are at present ...... mr sin chung - kai : madam president , a point of elucidation . president : secretary , just a minute , can you please give mr sin a chance to clarify his supplementary question as there may be some misunderstanding ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : yes . mr sin chung - kai : madam president , i was afraid if i raised my point of elucidation later , you might not allow me to do so . i did not say ftns operators failed to attain the commitments . i said the people practically did not have sufficient choices . even if ftns operators attain the so - called " performance commitments " , the people may not have sufficient choices . secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , perhaps we skip the issue of penetration which mr sin raised , but directly answer the question about price increases , which is mr sin 's concern . in fact , in part ( c ) of my main reply , i put forward an argument , which is that if local residential line service was cross - subsidized by other telecommunication services so that other operators have to provide services below cost , the investment incentive of operators would be adversely affected . on the other hand , if operation is done rationally and all operators are competing without cross - subsidization , ftns operators will have sufficient commercial incentive to extend their services to more remote areas and increase their coverage . miss choy so - yuk : madam president ...... president : excuse me , miss choy . it seems that mr sin has wanted to raise a follow - up question . mr sin , which part of your supplementary question has not been answered ? mr sin chung - kai : madam president , the secretary mentioned the word cross - subsidization . what did the word " cross - subsidization " mean , that is to say , what was the relevant differentiation ? president : was that part of your supplementary question ? if not , you cannot raise the question now . miss choy so - yuk : madam president , as the secretary said in her main reply , the relevant standards were not made on the network coverage in pres , private premises or commercial premises . thus , a situation may easily arise where ftns operators would tend to establish telecommunications networks in commercial premises for the profits would be much higher . by doing so , they may ignore some private premises , especially the speed with which they lay cables in pres would be affected . will the secretary inform this council whether , in order to enable all areas to have a fair share of attention , the government may make some adjustments in negotiating with ftns operators so that they will not concentrate on commercial premises in laying cables ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , members may in fact turn to the annex to my main reply and they will see that , by late 2002 , areas that can be reached by telecommunications cables will include those with pres galore , such as ngau tau kok , kwun tong , chai wan , shau kei wan , kwai chung , tsuen wan , tai po , sha tin , ma on shan , aberdeen and tsing yi . such areas have a certain ratio of pres . hence , we cannot see why pre tenants cannot obtain the relevant services . president : last supplementary question . mr fred li : madam president , despite what the secretary said , i find from the annex to the main reply , ngau tau kok , for example , is a place with a number of private industrial and commercial premises . tenants in the area may have a choice in late 2002 . will the secretary inform this council whether she would conduct a serious review ? the reason is that at present , some areas with a high density of pres , such as sau mau ping , lam tin and so on have fewer commercial premises and it seems coverage may not reach such areas , thereby depriving tenants of then choices . has the secretary noticed the situation ? if she has , would she take remedial action ? secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam president , in fact , i have already answered this question once . other than choices provided by ftns operators mentioned , alternative choices may also be made available by other operators . president : sixth question . despatch of water tankers for emergency water supply 6. mr ip kwok - him : madam president , regarding the despatch of water tankers for emergency water supply , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the numbers of water tankers currently operated by the water supplies department ( wsd ) and the food and environmental hygiene department ( fehd ) respectively , together with a breakdown by three service regions , namely the hong kong island , kowloon and the new territories , as well as the basis for determining the distribution of water tankers ; ( b ) of the respective numbers of occasions in which water tankers were deployed to provide water supply to the various regions last year ; and ( c ) whether it has assessed if the current number of water tankers is sufficient to cope with the demand ? secretary for works : madam president , ( a ) the numbers of water tankers currently operated by the wsd and the fehd are five and 66 respectively . their distribution by service region is as follows : the water tankers of the two departments perform different duties . the wsd 's water tankers are used for the provision of emergency water supply , while the fehd 's water tankers are mainly used for the department 's daily operational purposes , such as cleansing and watering of plant . the wsd 's water tankers are distributed on the basis of supply regions , with one tanker for each of the five supply regions in the territory . in fact , the kowloon regions as mentioned above cover some parts of the new territories , such as sai kung and kwai tsing , which are grouped with the " kowloon east " and " kowloon west " regions respectively . apart from this , the wsd also makes flexible arrangement in the deployment of water tankers . as kowloon lies between the hong kong island and the new territories , the two water tankers of the kowloon regions will provide cross - region support for the hong kong island or the new territories regions as and when required . in return , water tankers of the hong kong island or the new territories regions will provide the same support for the kowloon region . the fehd 's water tankers are distributed in accordance with the workload of various districts . they will provide support for the wsd 's emergency water supply services if necessary . ( b ) during the period from april 2000 to march 2001 , a total of 508 water tankers were deployed to various regions . this figure represented the total number of water tankers deployed on each occasion . their distribution by region is as follows : hong kong island kowloon new territories total ( number ) ( c ) when there is a disruption to the supply of water , the wsd will first of all ascertain whether important facilities such as hospitals , prisons , the airport , and so on , will be affected . it will also assess whether the problem will have serious impact on the residents , such as during the meal preparation time . under such circumstances , the wsd will immediately arrange temporary water supply for the residents . besides , the wsd will also assess the time required to resume the water supply . storage tanks are normally incorporated as part of the water supply systems of multi-storey buildings . these tanks can normally maintain water supply to their residents for several hours . the wsd will immediately arrange for temporary supply of water if the water supply cannot be resumed within a short time . water tankers are not always needed for the provision of temporary water supply . if other water mains are available in the vicinity of the affected area , a public standpipe will be connected to the fire hydrant to supply water to the residents within the shortest possible time . if such an arrangement is not feasible , water tankers will be deployed to provide temporary water supply . nevertheless , there are certain restrictions in deploying water tankers to provide water supply . since a water tanker , which has a storage capacity of 6cum , is relatively large in size , it may not be easy for it to enter a narrow access . there are also constraints in serving an area with a small but scattered population . the parking location of the water tanker has also to be carefully determined , taking into account the actual environment . the location of the tanker should prove convenient to the majority of the residents , ensure the traffic safety of those who queue up for water , and avoid any danger caused by over - crowdedness . in view of this , the wsd has recently introduced the use of mobile water tanks with a storage capacity of 1cum to support the water tankers in providing water supply in order to improve their services continuously . since the mobile water tanks can be transported by trucks , the wsd will have more flexibility in providing temporary water supply . besides , as the water tankers are only responsible for adding water to the mobile water tanks in such case , the demand for the tankers will be reduced . if the use of mobile water tanks is proven successful , the wsd will further promote such a measure . we are aware that suspension of water supply will cause inconvenience to the residents . as such , we will try various means to reduce the impact on the residents , such as completing the emergency repairs as soon as possible to resume normal water supply . in addition , information on suspension of water supply , temporary water supply arrangements and the estimated time for the resumption of normal water supply will be provided to the affected residents as soon as possible through the 24 - hour service of the wsd 's customer telephone enquiry centre , or through tv or radio broadcasts so that the residents may make timely preparations . on the deployment of water tankers , the wsd is supported by other departments and an effective liaison network exists between the departments concerned . therefore , on the whole , the current water tanker service is considered adequate . however , we will review the need from time to time , and will further enhance the service when necessary . mr ip kwok - him : madam president , emergency water supply is an issue that concerns hundreds to thousands of people . wah fu estate has experienced suspension of water supply for four times last month , one of which was the suspension of water supply in four buildings at the same time . the wsd had only dispatched one water tanker then , how could that be enough ? it was definitely not enough . the secretary stated in part ( a ) of his main reply that the fehd 's water tankers are dispatched in accordance with the workload of various districts . they will provide support for the wsd 's emergency water supply services if necessary . may i ask the secretary , on what mechanism are the 16 water tankers on hong kong island operated ? when the water supply in wah fu estate was suspended , only one water tanker was in service , no other water tanker was further available , would the secretary explained under what mechanism are the water tankers be deployed ? the secretary stated in part ( b ) of his main reply about the total number of water tankers deployed on each occasion . it has been mentioned that 508 water tankers have been deployed between april 2000 and march 2001 . would the figure include those dispatched by the fehd ? secretary for works : madam president , the question raised by mr ip kwok - him comprises various parts . i will first answer the last part of his question . we have deployed the fehd 's water tankers , out of the 508 water tankers i have just mentioned , 318 of which were dispatched by the wsd , and 190 water tankers were dispatched by the fehd . i have also mentioned that , in areas where there are frequent water pipe bursting , we would pay special attention to the emergency water supply service . fortunately , it does not happen frequently . for areas where water pipe bursting frequently happens , the department would first repair the water pipes without delay and then we would pay special attention to those areas and arrange for emergency water supplies . mr wong yung - kan : madam president , the secretary mentioned in part ( c ) of his main reply about the use of fire hydrants . it has been stated that when water pipe bursting occurred in areas such as housing estates , public standpipe will be connected to the fire hydrant to supply water to the residents . as far as i know , the use of fire hydrants for this purpose is prohibited in housing estates , therefore , would such action result in any contradictions ? secretary for works : madam president , what we have mentioned was in fact two different occasions . under normal circumstances , it is definitely not allowed . however , we are discussing the case when there is a disruption to the water supply due to pipe bursting . just as i have mentioned , the wsd will first of all check if other water mains are available in the vicinity of the affected area , if available , a public standpipe will be connected to provide temporary water supply . mr ng leung - sing : madam president , the secretary stated in his main reply that the wsd has recently introduced the use of mobile water tanks with a storage capacity of 1 cu m to enhance the flexibility of the water supply . may i ask the secretary what are the changes in the cost of water supply after the changeover to mobile water tanks ? the secretary also mentioned that if the use of mobile water tanks has proven successful , the wsd would further promote the measure . when would such changes take place ? secretary for works : madam president , i have already mentioned that , in order to make continuous improvements on our service , we would actively consider any other better alternatives . the mobile water tanks with a storage capacity of 1 cu m have only been used for a few months , and over this period of time , we found the use of mobile water tanks a very satisfactory mean to support the water tankers in providing water supply . as such , we will order more of these one cubic metre mobile water tanks to further enhance the flexibility of the water tankers , and to facilitate a more efficient arrangement of water supply . mr jasper tsang : madam president , would the government , as for other emergency services , make any performance pledge for temporary water supply , for instance , would there be any pledge to residents that the suspension of water supply would not exceed a certain period of time ? secretary for works : madam president , i would like to tackle the question from two aspects . firstly , if there was a pipe bursting , the water supply would undoubtedly be affected , our performance pledge then would be : in cases when there is an disruption of water supply due to water pipe bursting , 80% cases can resume water supply within eight hours , in cases when there is an disruption of water supply due to water pipe bursting , 90% cases can resume water supply within 12 hours . these refer to stable and normal water supply , but what i mentioned in the main reply was temporary water supply . under certain cases , although we could provide services according to our performance pledge , the water tanks in housing estates cannot maintain water supply for a relatively long period of time , therefore , we will arrange for temporary water supply by water tankers . mr ip kwok - him : madam president , i may have raised too many questions in my supplementary question , so the secretary has not answered some of my questions , with particular reference to the mechanism on which the water tankers are operated . i have already mentioned on that occasion , when there was a sudden disruption of water supply in four buildings , but only one water tanker had been dispatched . the residents have requested for additional water tankers , but the government has failed to do so . the residents were outrageous and there were voices of dissatisfaction . in this respect , may i ask the secretary how would the mechanism be operated to deploy the fehd 's water tankers to back up water supply ? secretary for works : madam president , i have mentioned in the main reply that there is one water tanker for each of the supply region in the territory . whenever necessary , for instance , there is a disruption of water supply in certain areas on hong kong island , we would usually deploy water tankers of the kowloon and the new territories regions to provide support . when there is greater demand for temporary water supply , we will liaise with the fehd to dispatch their water tankers for back up . the mechanism is simple , we would inform the fehd by telephone of the need for further support , and request for their assistance in the deployment of water tankers . mr ng leung - sing : madam president , thank you for allowing me to ask a supplementary question again , so that i can follow up the question i have just raised . the secretary has not answered my question . the wsd has to rent a lorry every time the one cu m water tank is used to support the water tankers , this would result in a change of costs . may i ask the secretary that , under such circumstances , how would the costs be affected ? secretary for works : madam president , the wsd is equipped with vehicles to transport the water tanks to the location where they are needed . these water tanks have to be filled up with the support of water tankers . the use of these water tanks has not generated any extra costs . president : last supplementary question . miss choy so - yuk : madam president , may i ask the secretary that , if such mechanism is to be operated , and the wsd called the fehd for their assistance , would the fehd process such request with priority ? or the fehd would first finish off their duties , such as the watering of plants and gardening , before they would provide support to the wsd and deploy the water tankers when available ? since this issue involves the water supply for residents and hospitals , would the fehd respond to the request with priority ? secretary for works : madam president , we understand that water supply is very important to the daily lives of the citizens , therefore , we inclined to take a more conservative approach , that is , to first deploy water tankers to the site . we would rather to have it not in service , then to have an inadequate water supply . regarding the question raised by miss choy so -

" the opinions of the preparatory committee for the hong kong special administrative region of the national people 's congress ( the preparatory committee ) on the implementation of article 24 para 2 of the basic law " , which were adopted on 10 august 1996 at its fourth plenary meeting , are that " people who have obtained permission to stay in hong kong under specific government policies " are not regarded as " having ordinarily resided " in hong kong . in this connection , will the government inform this council : ( a ) whether , having regard to the opinions of the preparatory committee , it has formulated criteria for determining which government policies are " specific policies " ; if so , of the criteria ; ( b ) of the current government policies that are " specific policies " ; and ( c ) of the respective numbers of persons who have obtained permission to stay in hong kong under each specific policy since 1 july 1997 ? secretary for security ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) under the immigration ordinance , persons falling under section 2 (4) shall not be treated as ordinarily resident in hong kong . they include persons permitted to stay in hong kong under specific government policies as referred to in the opinions of the preparatory committee on the implementation of article 24 para 2 of the basic law , which were adopted as its fourth plenary meeting held on 10 august 1996 . the formulation of such specific policies is based on the guiding principle that certain persons admitted for employment specifically for a short - term period , a particular project , or a particular employment contract should not become part of the permanent population of hong kong . ( b ) currently there are two such specific policies , relating to the employment of contract workers from outside hong kong under a government importation of labour scheme , and the employment of domestic helpers from outside hong kong . relevant provisions are in sections 2 (4) ( a ) ( v ) and ( vi ) of the immigration ordinance . ( c ) statistics on the number of visas issued to persons entering hong kong under each of the policies mentioned in part ( b ) since 1 july 1997 are set out below : contract worker year under a government importation of domestic helper * labour scheme * 1997 1147 26042 ( july to december ) ( january to april ) * number of visas issued pay reduction and voluntary departure scheme of mpfa 9. miss emily lau ( in chinese ) : madam president , it was reported that the mandatory provident fund schemes authority ( mpfa ) introduced in may this year a scheme , applicable to 10 - odd managerial staff members , under which they were given the options of demotion with pay reduction or voluntary departure . regarding this incident and the remuneration levels of the staff of other statutory bodies , will the executive authorities inform this council whether : ( a ) they know : ( i ) the reasons for the mpfa implementing such a scheme ; ( ii ) the details of the scheme , including the amount of money involved ; and ( iii ) the number of staff members affected and how they are affected ; and ( b ) they will make suggestions to other statutory bodies for reviewing if the remuneration levels of their staff are commensurate with their work ? secretary for financial services ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) ( i ) reasons for conducting the demotion / reduction of salary and voluntary departure plan the implementation of the salary reduction / voluntary departure plan is a result of the recommendation of the organizational structure review , which was approved by the mpfa management board on 10 may 2001 . the organizational structure of mpfa has hitherto been based on the recommendations of a consultancy study conducted in 1998 , prior to the establishment of mpfa and the commencement of mpfa 's regulatory work . this organizational structure , which was designed for processing a large amount of work , met the requirements of mpfa at its initial stage of development . the launch of the mandatory provident fund ( mpf ) system in december 2000 marked the completion of preparatory phases and the beginning of the full implementation of the mpf system . the mpf system is new and the emphasis of mpfa 's work would be changed as necessary to meet operational needs . furthermore , being a new regulator , it is necessary for the mpfa to periodically review its organization and establishment so that in the course of its development , the mpfa could respond effectively and flexibly to the changing focus of its functions and the tasks it performs . ( ii ) details of the package for those staff who are required to leave the service as a result of the organizational review , the mpfa will offer the following : - give requisite notice for termination of service : one month for those on probation , and three months for confirmed staff , or payment - in - lieu ; - encash all accrued annual leave ; - an ex-gratia payment calculated as follows : for up to 12 months in the equivalent to one month 's 1st year of service basic salary in the 2nd year of service - for less than six months plus equivalent to half month 's basic salary - for six months or more plus equivalent to one month 's basic salary the total ex-gratia payment to be made to affected employees who will have to leave the service is about $740,000 . ( iii ) the number of staff affected and the impact on them eighteen managers are affected , one of whom has already tendered resignation ; six would stay until 31 march 2002 to meet the short - term operational needs of the mpfa . another six were offered senior officer positions but the offer was declined . the six managers concerned , together with the remaining five managers ( that is , 11 in total ) , will leave the service and receive ex-gratia payment . ( b ) the government normally does not intervene into the pay and conditions of service for employees of statutory organizations , as these are employment matters between the employees and the management of the organizations concerned . where the statutory organizations are subvented by the government , the government 's guidelines on the management and control of government subventions apply , including the general rule that the terms of service for subvented posts may not be superior to those of civil servants in comparable grades . taxi drivers ' practice of multiple loading of passengers 10. mr lau kong - wah ( in chinese ) : madam president , regarding taxi drivers ' practice of multiple loading of passengers and charging them individually ( commonly known as " taxi pooling " ) , will the government inform this council : ( a ) of the number of complaints about such practice received last year , together with a breakdown by the districts where such taxi drivers picked up their passengers ; ( b ) of the follow - up actions it has taken upon receipt of such complaints ; ( c ) of the measures to crack down on the taxi drivers engaging in such practice ; and ( d ) whether it plans to review the penalty for such offences ? secretary for transport ( in chinese ) : madam president , in 2000 , the hong kong police force ( the police ) received 20 complaints about taxi drivers engaged in " taxi pooling " activities . a breakdown of these 20 complaints received by the districts where the alleged taxi pooling activities were found is given below : district where the alleged taxi number of complaints received by pooling activities were found the police in 2000 upon receipt of a complaint about taxi drivers engaged in " taxi pooling " activities , the police will conduct investigation and take appropriate prosecution action as necessary and appropriate . the investigation of the 20 complaints mentioned above resulted in prosecution in four cases , of which there were two successful convictions for the offence of " permitting any person other than the hirer to enter the taxi without the consent of the hirer " . the offenders were each fined a sum of $1,500 . two of the other 16 complaints were subsequently withdrawn by the complainants . as for the remaining 14 complaints , there was insufficient evidence after investigation for further follow - up action . to avoid " taxi pooling " activities , the police will strengthen the deployment of plain - clothed officers to patrol the major areas and carry out target - oriented enforcement operations . analyses are conducted from time to time based on feedbacks from various sources to ascertain the need to revise the level of penalty . at present the offence of " permitting any person other than the hirer to enter the taxi without the consent of the hirer " carries a maximum penalty of a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for six months , whereas the more serious offence of " soliciting passengers " carries a maximum penalty of a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months . so far , there is no indication that the current level of penalty has lost its deterrence effect . a review is therefore not planned for the time being . supervision of private schools by education department 11. mr david chu ( in chinese ) : madam president , it was reported that the hong kong college of management was closed in mid - may . as at 17 may , the consumer council had received a total of 144 complaints from students of the college , involving prepaid tuition fees amounting to $1.3 million . with regard to the education department 's ( ed ) supervision of private schools , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the total number of complaints received by the ed against the college since january 1999 , together with a breakdown by subjects of complaint ; how ed followed up such complaints , and the reasons for the failure of such follow - up actions to rectify the college 's malpractices at an earlier stage and reduce the students ' losses ; and ( b ) the measures the ed takes , apart from instituting prosecutions , to prevent private schools from overcharging fees and mismanaging their affairs ?

( b ) at present , the education ordinance ( cap . 279 ) requires that school fees have to be approved by the director of education ( de ) . the ordinance also empowers the de to cancel the registration of a school or a school manager , appoint additional managers to sit on the school management committee or direct remedial measures to be taken within a specified period , if a school is found not to be managed satisfactorily . apart from enforcing the ordinance , the ed also takes the following measures to prevent schools from overcharging fees and mismanaging their affairs : ( i ) organizing briefing sessions for school operators to draw their attention to the relevant provisions of the education ordinance and the importance of complying with these provisions ; ( ii ) launching publicity , for example , api and radio broadcast , to alert parents and students of possible malpractices of private schools ; and ( iii ) publishing approved school fees on the ed 's website for public information . basis for calculating medical unit costs 12. miss emily lau ( in chinese ) : madam president , will the executive authorities ( a ) inform this council of the current unit costs in respect of the following services provided by the hospital authority ( ha ) : ( i ) cost per bed day occupied for acute and general hospitals ; ( ii ) cost per specialist outpatient attendance ; and ( iii ) cost per accident & emergency ( a & e ) attendance ; and ( b ) give a detailed account of how the above figures are computed ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) information on the average unit cost of the following services provided by the ha in 1999-2000 is shown below : type of services average unit cost general inpatient services per bed day $3,358 in acute and general hospitals specialist out - patient services per $638 attendance a & e services per attendance $588 the ha is in the process of collating full - year cost data for 2000-01 . as such , the average unit cost for 2000-01 for the services in question is not yet available . ( b ) the unit cost of general inpatient services per bed day is calculated on the basis of cost data of all acute general beds in 27 acute and general hospitals , that of specialist out - patient services on the basis of the cost data of all 51 ha specialist out - patient clinics and that of a & e services per attendance on the cost data of 15 a & e departments in the ha . the average unit cost is computed by dividing the estimated total costs of providing a particular type of service in a reference period by the corresponding total patient activities in the same period . the total costs include the estimated costs incurred by the ha ( such as staff costs , administration overheads , depreciation , drugs , medical consumables and utility charges ) and the costs of services provided to the ha by the government departments ( such as architectural services department for building maintenance services , electrical and mechanical services department for electrical and mechanical services and department of health for certain medical services ) . water quality of bottled natural mineral water and distilled water 13. mr lau kong - wah ( in chinese ) : madam president , regarding the water quality of bottled natural mineral water and distilled water on sale in hong kong , will the government inform this council whether : ( a ) it has stipulated the water quality standards such bottled water is required to meet ; if so , how such standards compare with the international standards ; if not , of the reasons for that ; ( b ) laboratory tests are conducted regularly on such bottled water ; if so , of the results of such tests conducted in the past year , and how cases of substandard quality have been followed up ; if not , how the administration ensures that such bottled water is suitable for human consumption ; and ( c ) it knows the countries and regions which regularly conduct laboratory tests on the water quality of bottled water ; whether the administration has sought the relevant information from the organizations concerned for reference ? secretary for the environment and food ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) both bottled natural mineral water and distilled water on sale in hong kong are food items subject to regulation under the " public health and municipal services ordinance " ( cap . 132 ) . this ordinance provides that all food items ( including bottled drinking water ) on sale must be suitable for human consumption . subsidiary legislation under the ordinance also provides specific standards in respect of the amount of artificial sweeteners , colouring materials , preservatives , minerals oils and heavy metals contained in food . the food and environmental hygiene department ( fehd ) conducts laboratory tests on bottled drinking water against the statutory standards . it also conducts laboratory tests on the level of micro - organism in bottled drinking water in accordance with the " standard for natural mineral waters " laid down by the codex alimentarius commission under the united nations and the " guideline for drinking - water quality " of the world health organization . the standards adopted in hong kong are similar to international standards .

( b ) the lands resumption ordinance ( cap . 124 ) provides , among other things , for the payment of statutory compensation for land resumption and for the associated claims for loss of business . under the ordinance , claims for statutory compensation have to be supported by documentary proof . affected owners and occupiers often need to spend considerable time and effort to produce evidence to support their claims . in some cases , affected occupiers had difficulties or were unable to produce sufficient documentary proof of business loss to support their claims . to enable prompt dealing with affected businesses , the finance committee of the legislative council approved an ega to facilitate early resolution of the claim procedures involving industrial and commercial properties . under this arrangement , occupiers concerned may opt to receive the ega in lieu of their right to make statutory claims for business loss arising from land resumption . the rates for this ega was last revised by the finance committee on 30 march 2001 . other than the statutory compensation for affected owners and occupiers , the government does not provide land for commercial or industrial operators to re-establish their businesses after assumption . affected operators need to find alternative premises that will suit their own business operations . affected industrial clearees in a number of recent land resumption exercises have put forward the view that the existing ega arrangements are not adequate to facilitate the removal and re - establishment of their industrial operations . in view of this , we are undertaking a review of the compensation arrangements for industrial operators affected by land resumption . we will brief members on our proposals once the review is completed . breeding of termites in public housing units 15. miss li fung - ying ( in chinese ) : madam president , regarding the handling of the issue about the breeding of termites in the public housing units of the hong kong housing authority ( ha ) and the hong kong housing society ( hs ) , will the government inform this council whether it knows : ( a ) the respective numbers of relevant complaints received by the ha and the hs from residents in each of the past three years ; ( b ) if the ha and the hs have assessed the damage caused by termites to the units and the property of the residents ; if so , of the details of the damage over the past three years ; and ( c ) the details of the existing procedures adopted by the ha and the hs to eradicate termites and whether they regularly assess the effectiveness of their termite eradication efforts ; if not , of the reasons for that ? secretary for housing ( in chinese ) : madam president , the numbers of complaints about termites in public rental housing flats operated by the ha and the hs , together with the expenses of termite treatment and repairs , in the past three years are given below : ha hs ( total no . of tenants : 2013000 ) ( total no . of tenants : 102700 ) neither the ha nor the hs has assessed separately the damage to flats . no report of damage to tenants ' property has been received . on receiving a tenant 's complaint about termite problem , the ha or the hs will arrange for a pest control contractor to carry out anti-termite treatment . the contractor is required to examine the flat thoroughly and to exterminate all surface and hidden termites and their nests . post-treatment guarantee up to a year is provided to ensure effectiveness . both the ha and the hs monitor regularly their arrangements for termite control in housing estates . statistics on suicide cases 16. mr michael mak ( in chinese ) : madam president , regarding suicide in each of the past two years , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the number of persons who died in suicide , with a breakdown by their age and sex , and the causes and means of suicide ; ( b ) the proportion of the number of persons who died in suicide to the total population of hong kong ; and ( c ) the number of persons who attempted suicide ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) the census and statistics department compiles mortality statistics , which cover suicide , using information on deaths registered with the immigration department . tables 1 and 2 show the number of known suicide deaths in 1998 and 1999 by age group and sex , and by means of suicide . this source does not capture information on the reasons for suicide . compilation of suicide statistics involves a substantial lead time . this is due to the need to establish , for certain cases , that these are indeed suicide cases ( involving police investigation , autopsy , inquest by the coroner and so on ) . as such , final statistics for 2000 are not yet available . ( b ) the crude suicide death rates in 1998 and 1999 , per 100000 of the population , were 12.3 and 12.1 respectively . ( c ) there are no official statistics on the number of attempted suicides in hong kong . this is partly due to the limitations in various systems in arriving at a global figure which fully reflects the situation , the complexity in ascertaining whether cases are attempted suicide and underreporting of such sensitive information by persons who have attempted suicide . nevertheless , some relevant data is available for reference , as the government provides assistance to persons known to have attempted to commit suicide and their family members , who are willing to come forward for help . the social welfare department maintains records on new attempted suicide cases known to its family services centres , those of non - governmental organizations , and public hospitals served by its medical social service units . the number of persons known to this system for the year ending 31 march 2000 was 1522 and for the year ending 31 march 2001 was 1220 . recognizing that the number of cases captured by this system is not exhaustive , efforts are being made to improve the system and collect data from other service units , where practicable . table 1 known suicide deaths by age group and sex , 1998-1999 table 2 known suicide deaths by type of suicide , 1998-1999 number footnote the suicide figures presented in tables 1 and 2 refer to the number of suicide deaths which occurred in a particular year and were known at the time of publication . they are based on the findings of the verdict by the coroner 's court and registered with the immigration department known at the time of publication . supply and demand of international school places 17. dr yeung sum ( in chinese ) : madam president , it has been reported that , due to a shortage of places in schools under the english schools foundation and other international schools , some foreign professionals abandoned their plans to come to work in hong kong after they had failed to secure for their children such school places . in this connection , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the supply and demand position of international school places in hong kong in the past three years ; and ( b ) the plans to ensure a sufficient supply of international school places for the children of expatriate professionals working in hong kong ? secretary for education and manpower ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) international schools refer to schools which offer a non-local curriculum . the provision of international school places and enrolment in the past three years are as follows : ( b ) the government conducts annual surveys on the provision of international school places and the actual enrolment . while it can be seen from ( a ) above that the overall provision of international school places in hong kong is adequate , the demand is unevenly distributed . the more popular schools have a long waiting list . with china 's imminent accession to the world trade organization and as the economy recovers , we envisage an expansion of the expatriate community and in turn , an increasing demand for international school places . in view of the lead time for construction of new schools and the difficulty of projecting the demand for international school places of various national curricula , the government is taking active steps to increase the provision of good quality , non - profit - making private independent schools ( piss ) which can cater for the needs of both expatriate and local students . international school operators are also encouraged to run them . non - profit - making piss are eligible for land grants at nominal premium and capital grants ( up to 100% of the cost of building a standard design primary or secondary public sector school of the same student population ) for the construction of school premises . they may offer a local or non-local curriculum , such as the international baccalaureate or other national curricula , with the study of chinese language , chinese history and culture being part of the core curriculum . five pis applications were approved in the past two years , of which two are expected to begin operation in the 2003-04 school year . we will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action to ensure that the education needs of our expatriate community are properly met . provision of education services for children in children 's homes 18. mr james to ( in chinese ) : madam president , it was reported that , in its investigation report published last month , the hong kong human rights monitor alleged that the social welfare department ( swd ) had neglected the educational needs of the children in some of the children 's homes it operated , which was not in conformity with international human rights standards . in this connection , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the number of children in each children 's home operated by the swd at present , together with a breakdown by age bands and sex , and the number of teaching staff ; and ( b ) the measures the swd will take to improve the educational services provided to the children in the children 's homes it operates , such as the number of additional teaching staff and the new courses to be provided ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) the administration is committed to providing education for all residents of children 's homes operated by the swd , which is consistent with obligations under the united nations convention on the rights of the child . the number of children ( with a breakdown by age and sex ) and the number of teaching staff in each of these homes is provided in the annex . of the 31 teachers , one is a principal assistant master based in the swd 's headquarters with the role of co-ordinating the education programmes in the homes . six are senior assistant masters / mistresses , seven are assistant masters / mistresses and 17 are certificated masters / mistresses . these staff work in the homes and conduct teaching programmes for the residents . in addition , eight workshop instructors iii and 13 workshop instructors ii assist in delivering educational programmes . ( b ) the swd has plans to strengthen the teaching establishments in both the short - term and long - term homes to improve the educational services provided . eight graduate teacher posts will be provided by september 2001 . one senior education officer post will be created in the swd 's headquarters and will be responsible for the effective implementation and professional development of the education service . two education officer posts and five assistant education officer posts will be created to assume teaching duties in the homes . the prime objective of the educational activities in the homes is to facilitate the reintegration of residents into mainstream schools or the job market . subjects offered in the curriculum include chinese language , english language , mathematics , social studies , and pre-vocational training such as plumbing , air - conditioning repair , printing and it application and so on . it training for residents in all the homes has been enhanced since 1999 . residents also participate in numerous open competitions and public examinations , covering choral speaking , sports , english , typing and word processing and so on . annex profile of residents and teaching establishments in the swd 's homes ( as at 30 april 2001 ) long - term homes shatin boys home : a probation home for boys age boys capacity : 100 12 1 13 7 14 23 15 46 strength of teaching staff : fanling girls home : a probation home for girls o pui shan boys ' home : a reformatory school for boys wai yee hostel : a non-statutory home for girls short - term homes ma tau wai girls ' home : a place of refuge , a remand home and a place of detention for girls total 58 begonia road juvenile home : a remand home and a place of detention for boys 2 workshop instructors pui chi boys ' home : a place of refuge and a place of detention for boys note : in addition to the seven institutions above , the swd also operates the kwun tong hostel . it is a probation hostel for boys aged 15 to 21 . it is an open institution , and the boys leave the hostel in the daytime to work . donations to private charitable funds by administration 19. mr albert ho ( in chinese ) : madam president , regarding the donations made by the administration from public funds or other sources to privately established and managed charitable funds , will the government inform this council of : ( a ) the following information regarding each of the private charitable funds which received such donations in the past five years : ( i ) the name and objective of each fund , and the current membership list of its board of directors and executive committee ; and ( ii ) the amount of donation received and its uses , and the titles of the major events organized , in each of the past five years ; and ( b ) the measures to ensure that the principles of fairness and openness are adhered to in making decisions on donations to charitable funds , and to prevent any conflict of interests which may arise due to civil servants serving as directors or executive committee members of such funds ? secretary for the treasury ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) each year the administration makes donations for various purposes to a lot of privately established and managed charitable funds or organizations . the donations are mainly made from the disaster relief fund and the general revenue account . the donations made from the disaster relief fund for the past five years are listed in appendix 1 . the bulk of donations made from the general revenue account come from capital expenditure under head 106 miscellaneous services . a list of the relevant items in the past five years under this category is at appendix 2 . in view of the large number of allocations involved as indicated in the appendices , it is impossible to provide detailed information on each and every fund or organization that received such donations for the past five years and the events they organized . ( b ) in dealing with such allocations , we will fully consider all the relevant factors , including the availability of similar charitable funds or activities having regard to the need for fairness and openness as well as the need of the beneficiaries . in addition , donations under the disaster relief fund are made on the advice of the disaster relief fund advisory committee as required under the resolution passed by members in 1993 . the consent of the finance committee is required for a grant in excess of $8 million under the disaster relief fund . for non-recurrent allocations exceeding $10 million from the general revenue account to privately funded organizations , the approval of the finance committee is required . there are stringent rules on conflict of interest governing civil servants serving as directors or executive committee members of privately established charitable funds . civil service circular no . 19/92 stipulates clearly that a civil servant : ( i ) must not use his official position , nor any information made available to him in his capacity as a civil servant , to benefit himself or his family , or to favour his relations or friends or any group of people to whom he is obliged in anyway ; and ( ii ) must avoid putting himself in a position which creates reasonable suspicion that he has done so . in addition , if a civil servant serves on the board of directors of a privately established charitable fund in his private capacity , he is also subject to the stringent reporting requirements under civil service regulations 550 to 564 on outside work . appendix 1 disaster relief fund ( payments ) head 800 -

chi ( in chinese ) : madam president , regarding the services provided to young night drifters ( ynds ) who regularly hang around in the streets or in places of entertainment late at night , will the government inform this council : ( a ) whether it has estimated the present number of ynds aged between 12 and 21 ; if so , of the details of its estimation , and the major districts where they usually hang around , as well as their popular hangouts ; ( b ) whether it has assessed the effectiveness of the pilot scheme , under which ynds are taken to police stations to wait for their parents to bring them home , in tackling the ynd problem ; if so , of the details of its assessment ; ( c ) of the current manning scale of outreaching services targeted at ynds ; ( d ) of the maximum numbers of young people that can be accommodated at any one time in activity centres and other service centres which are open for ynds at night , as well as their respective usage rates ; and ( e ) whether it will consider opening some cultural and sports facilities or other community facilities late at night to attract ynds to the activities held in such facilities , thereby reducing the chances of their being recruited into triad societies ; if so , of the details ; if not , the reasons for that ? secretary for health and welfare ( in chinese ) : madam president , ( a ) to examine the service needs of ynds , the administration conducted a pilot youth mobile team ( ymt ) service project between 1997 and 1999 . based on data obtained from this pilot scheme , 10277 ynds were identified over a 16 month period . of these , 4713 ( 46% ) were assessed to have no need for service ; 1905 ( 19% ) were assessed either to have no immediate need for service or were already receiving service from other social workers during the day ; 2182 ( 21% ) were assessed to be in need of service but declined receipt ; and 1477 ( 14% ) received services from the two ymts . most of the young people were between the age of 14 and 17 . the districts where ynds were most prevalent included eastern , yau tsim mong , tai po , sham shui po and kwai tsing . parks and playgrounds were popular spots , where ynds congregated . ( b ) based on similar schemes in tuen mun and yuen long police districts , a pilot scheme ( the juveniles case scheme ) was introduced by the police in tai po police district in september 2000 . the objective is to protect juveniles under 16 by dissociating them from the risk of becoming involved in crime or being exposed to undesirable influences . beat police officers approach juveniles found on the streets between midnight and 6 am to see if they are in need of care and protection . if so , they are escorted to a police station and their parents are contacted and requested to take them home . for juveniles who have been taken to a police station on three or more occasions , the police will liaise with the social welfare department to ascertain whether care or protection proceedings are required . to date , this has not happened . up to 31 march 2001 , 60 juveniles have been reached by the scheme , with only one individual being found on two occasions . we will continue to monitor the operation of the scheme and introduce measures to enhance its effectiveness , having regard to , feedback from the community , crime prevention , juvenile protection , and the degree of assistance provided to juveniles and their families . in february 2001 , the police conducted a questionnaire survey amongst the parents or guardians of the juveniles reached under the scheme . the vast majority supported the scheme whilst a few found it inconvenient to take their children home from police stations late at night . the scheme is also supported by the north and tai po district fight crime committees , local youth agencies and members of school discipline master committees in the north district . the police and the social welfare department will discuss how the scheme can be further improved , by taking into account the views of professional social workers involved in youth work . ( c ) since the completion of the pilot project referred to in paragraph ( a ) , a number of outreach social work teams ( oswts ) and integrated teams ( its ) have extended their operating hours to serve ynds . as they provide services to ynds as part of their work with young people , there is no separate manning ratio for the ynd service . in 2001-02 , the administration has earmarked additional recurrent resources to strengthen the manpower provision of 18 its ( with an addition of three professional social workers to each it ) to provide targeted services to ynds . each of the 18 selected its will also be provided with a van and mobile phones to facilitate efficient service delivery . ( d ) based on data obtained from the two pilot ymts , 46% of ynds were assessed to have no need for service from social work units . the service needs of the remaining 54% included assistance to be off the street to avoid exposure to danger , assistance to handle their problems in the family context , assistance to handle negative peer influence , services to promote their mental health , services to prevent the occurrence of at - risk behaviour , and an employment service . the objectives of the ymts were to provide on the spot crisis intervention , including escort services to homes or temporary shelters , if required ; to provide short - term intervention , including welfare referrals and , if necessary , escorting them to the relevant welfare agencies ; and to arrange for them to receive mainstream youth services to facilitate their social and personal development . in the light of this experience , the 18 its identified for expansion to serve ynds will help develop programmes to meet the multifarious needs of ynds . the oswts and its serving ynds provide a wide range of services according to needs , including various services in their centres for ynds at night . however , the present reporting system does not require them to provide statistics on night - time centre - based services for ynds . the 18 its will also provide night - time centre - based services according to needs in their districts . in addition to these centre based facilities , residential centres have been provided to meet the needs of ynds who are temporarily unable or unwilling to stay at home . financial support from the government has been provided to a non-governmental organization ( ngo ) to operate two crisis residential centres in sha tin and eastern districts , providing a total of 30 places . between january and april 2001 , the utilization rates of the two centres were 84% and 98%. additional recurrent subvention has also been provided since may 2001 to enable another ngo to operate a similar temporary residential service ( eight places ) in kowloon for ynds . ( e ) community centres and community halls run by the home affairs department are open daily from 9 am to 10 pm . leisure facilities and civic centres under the management of the leisure and cultural services department normally open until 10 pm to 11.30 pm . in the short - term , applications from youth organizations or service providers to organize activities for ynds at these venues late at night , will be considered on a case by case basis . in the long term , if experience demonstrates that night - time opening is an effective means to help meet the objectives of the welfare services provided to ynds , we will consider how the operation of these facilities can be changed to contribute towards this process . bills first reading of bills president : bills : first reading . companies ( amendment ) bill 2001 post secondary colleges ( amendment ) bill 2001 employment ( amendment ) bill 2001 clerk : companies ( amendment ) bill 2001 post secondary colleges ( amendment ) bill 2001 employment ( amendment ) bill 2001 . bills read the first time and ordered to be set down for second reading pursuant to rule 53 (3) of the rules of procedure . second reading of bills president : bills : second reading . companies ( amendment ) bill 2001 secretary for financial services : madam president , i move that the companies ( amendment ) bill 2001 be read the second time . the bill seeks to amend the relevant provisions of the companies ordinance to allow listed companies incorporated in hong kong ( listed companies ) to issue summary financial reports . all limited companies incorporated in hong kong , including listed companies , are required under the companies ordinance to send financial documents that are to be laid before the company at a general meeting to their shareholders , debenture holders and other entitled persons ( shareholders and relevant persons ) not less than 21 days before the date of the meeting . the documents comprise the balance sheet with its annexes , the director 's report and the auditor 's report . shareholders in general may not have interest in the financial documents given their length and complexity , and may not read them in detail . taking into account overseas experience , we consider that there is room for improvement in the present arrangement . we propose to amend the companies ordinance to allow listed companies to send summary financial reports in lieu of the full set of financial documents to their shareholders and relevant persons . the summary financial report sets out the important information of the company in a simpler and more concise manner to facilitate better understanding of the operation , business and financial position of a listed company by general investors . moreover , the printing of summary financial reports , in comparison with that of the full sets of financial reports , will consume less paper and hence is more environmentally friendly . madam president , the main purpose of allowing listed companies to issue summary financial reports is to provide the shareholders and relevant persons with an additional choice and the shareholders ' right of access to full corporate information will not be affected . the bill provides that a listed company shall only send a summary financial report to shareholders and relevant persons after it has ascertained their wishes and obtained their consent to do so . shareholders and relevant persons may still ask for a full set of financial documents from the company even if they have selected to receive the summary financial report and have received it , subject to the request being made prior to the next general meeting . the company is required to send out the documents within 14 days upon receipt of the relevant notification . i should also point out that under the bill , a listed company would be considered to have fulfilled its legal requirement of sending a summary financial report if he published the report on its website and notified the shareholders and relevant persons who had agreed with this arrangement of such posting . this arrangement would also apply to the sending of the full set of financial documents . this proposal would further promote electronic communication between listed companies and their shareholders . the above proposals are set out in the companies ( amendment ) bill 2001 . as regards the details of implementation , such as the contents of summary financial reports and how to ascertain the wishes of shareholders and relevant persons , they will be provided in the form of regulations after the bill has been passed . in other jurisdictions such as the united kingdom , australia and singapore , listed companies are allowed to issue summary financial reports and the arrangement has been accepted by listed companies and shareholders alike . madam president , i hope that members will support this bill , which not only will bring convenience to shareholders and relevant persons , but will also be environmentally friendly . president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the companies ( amendment ) bill 2001 be read the second time . in accordance with the rules of procedure , the debate is now adjourned and the bill referred to the house committee . post secondary colleges ( amendment ) bill 2001 secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i move that the post secondary colleges ( amendment ) bill 2001 be read the second time . the bill seeks to enable a post-secondary college registered under the post secondary colleges ordinance to award degrees , subject to the prior approval of the chief executive in council . the hong kong shue yan college ( shue yan college ) is currently the only post-secondary college registered under the ordinance . the proposed amendments , if enacted , will enable shue yan college to offer four degree programmes starting from september this year . the chief executive in council has approved in principle that shue yan college may award these degrees , subject to programme validation by the hong kong council for academic accreditation . shue yan college has a vision to become a local private university . the attainment of degree - awarding status is a major step towards this goal . i commend the bill to members and hope that it will be passed within the current legislative session so that shue yan college can launch the degree programmes in september this year . president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the post secondary colleges ( amendment ) bill 2001 be read the second time . in accordance with the rules of procedure , the debate is now adjourned and the bill referred to the house committee . employment ( amendment ) bill 2001 secretary for education and manpower : madam president , i move that the employment ( amendment ) bill 2001 be read the second time . the principal amendments of the bill aim to clarify that an employer 's contribution to a relevant mandatory provident fund ( mpf ) scheme may be set off against any severance payment or long service payment due to the employee , irrespective of whether or not the employee has already withdrawn the accrued benefits in the mpf scheme . sections 31i and 31y of the employment ordinance provide for the offsetting arrangements . however , the existing provisions are worded in such a way that offsetting can only occur if the mpf scheme benefits are still being held in an mpf scheme . under normal circumstances , employees are not allowed to withdraw their accrued mpf benefits without leaving employment and hence are covered by the existing provisions . there are , however , exceptional cases . for example , if the employee has already withdrawn his entire accrued mpf scheme benefits upon reaching the age of 65 , the retirement age prescribed under the mandatory provident fund schemes ordinance , but continues employment with the same employer , then when the employee eventually leaves the employment , the employer would not be able to offset his contribution to the employee 's mpf scheme against the severance payment or long service payment due to the employee . also , some mpf scheme rules do allow the flexibility for employees to withdraw the accrued benefits in respect of the employers ' voluntary contribution before leaving employment . this is not in line with the original policy intent . we , therefore , propose to amend the relevant provisions so as to reflect fully and clearly the original policy intent which is to allow offsetting of severance payment or long service payment against mpf scheme benefits attributable to the employer 's contribution in all circumstances . although there have not been any reported cases of double payments , to effectively preserve the original policy intent , we propose that the bill should take effect from the date of gazettal . this is necessary to avoid the possibility , however remote , of any employee taking advantage of the unintended loophole in the ordinance and withdraw his accrued mpf scheme benefits before the bill is passed . madam president , the bill contains amendments which are purely technical in nature . i commend the bill to honourable members and urge that members approve the bill as soon as possible . president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the employment ( amendment ) bill 2001 be read the second time . in accordance with the rules of procedure , the debate is now adjourned and the bill referred to the house committee . members ' motions president : members ' motions . two motions with no legislative effect . i have accepted the recommendations of the house committee as to the time limits on speeches for the motion debates . under the rules of procedure , i am obliged to direct any member speaking in excess of the specified time to discontinue . first motion : bridging the digital divide . bridging the digital divide mr sin chung - kai : madam president , i move that the motion , as printed on the agenda , be passed . the motion i move today is " bridging the digital divide " . over the past few years , hong kong has made remarkable achievements and rapid development in the field of information and communication technologies ( ict ) . today , ict has already closely knitted with our everyday lives . mobile phone , electronic mail and the internet have gradually become our major means of communication . while we can learn what is happening in the world without leaving home , inter - personal communication and information exchange have become more convenient and direct . as regards electronic - business , it is not only an inevitable trend of the new economy but also a key to unlimited business opportunities . as members of the it sector , we should really take pride in the development of hong kong in recent years into one of the leading digital cities in asia and even worldwide . at the meeting of the legislative council panel on information technology and broadcasting held on 14th may , i chaired a public hearing relating to the digital divide issue . members from 14 bodies representing different sectors in society attended the meeting to express their complaints about the issue . they pointed out clearly that due to various reasons , certain members of our community so far could not enjoy the benefits of ict . at that meeting , we learnt that people with disabilities were unable to buy the supplementary computer facilities that suit their needs because they could not afford the huge costs involved , and that senior citizens , because of their low education level , simply could not appreciate the benefits of ict and thus did not have any confidence in learning the use of computer . we have heard that the blind and the visually impaired were unable to read certain information online because the design of the websites concerned had not catered for their needs . what is more , we have also heard that some low - income families were unable to apply for any internet services because they did not have any credit cards , as the majority of internet service providers would only accept payment by credit cards . we know it very well that digital divide is indeed existing in hong kong . despite the fact that the hong kong government has been striving hard to develop hong kong into a leading digital city , the issue of digital divide has all along been overlooked . digital divide refers to the gap between individuals at different social - economic levels with regard to their opportunities to access ict for a variety of activities . during the times of rapid ict development , the " digitally rich " , being able to exploit the opportunities and benefits of ict , can further enhance their quality of life . to the " digitally poor " , however , instead of contributing towards the enhancement of their lives , ict will only push them further to the margin of society and leave them in a far more disadvantageous position . to put it simply , digital divide is a form of polarization between the rich and the poor and a social phenomenon bred from the process of ict development . last month , in the document " the 2001 digital 21 strategy : connecting the world " published by the information technology and broadcasting bureau , the administration gives an account of the achievements hong kong has made in respect of ict development . at the same time , it also points out that digital divide is less a problem in hong kong as compared with other places in the world . the document tells us that our mobile phone penetration rate is among the highest in the world , one third of our population are internet users , and broadband networks have covered all business premises and over 95% of households in hong kong . judging from these figures , it seems that our ict development is not lagging behind the major developed countries in asia , and that apparently digital divide is not so visible an issue in hong kong . however , the fact is another story . if we make a comparison of the disadvantageous groups in hong kong and other developed countries in terms of their computer penetration rate and internet penetration rate , we can see that the pace of ict diffusion in hong kong is much slower than that of other countries and is thus more worrying . according to the use of ict survey conducted by the census and statistics department last year , the majority of the low - income , lowly educated and economically less active members of our community , such as housewives , retirees and senior citizens , very seldom use ict . taking the lowly educated as an example , only 3.3% of those in hong kong are internet users . this rate is much lower than the 22%, 11% and 7.5% recorded in taiwan , the united states and singapore respectively . another example is the internet penetration rate among the economically inactive . the mere rate of 7.5% recorded in hong kong is lower than not only the 7.8% and 17% recorded in singapore and britain respectively , but also the internet penetration rates among the non-employed people and non-working population in the united states , which stand at 45.3% and 29% respectively . further still , the ict exploitation rate among the elderly in hong kong also arouses concern . while only 3.4% of our elderly persons have surfed the internet , the corresponding figures in japan , the united states , britain , taiwan and singapore are 33.2%, 29.6%, 13%, 10% and 5.3% respectively . so , we can see that the situation in hong kong compares less favourably with the places mentioned . one of the reasons why the issue of digital divide has not been given widespread attention is that the administration has all along focused on making a comparison of the overall ict penetration rate in hong kong and other countries to the neglect of the ict needs of the disadvantageous groups . as a matter of fact , digital divide is indeed an existing issue in hong kong . polarization between the " digitally rich " and the " digitally poor " is obvious and there is an aggravating tendency . unlike the government 's remark that digital divide is less a problem in hong kong as compared with other places in the world , the issue is far more complicated and serious than we have imagined , only that the administration has overlooked its existence . actually , developed countries like the united states , britain , australia , korea , japan , singapore , and so on , have started conducting in - depth researches into the issue since the mid ' 90s and formulated comprehensive policies on digital divide , with a view to narrowing down the gap and preventing the issue from impacting gravely on the development of the digital economy as a whole . the hong kong government , however , seems to have difficulty inappreciating the seriousness of the issue . just imagine , if a large number of people are still unaware of the benefits of ict or unable to exploit ict when the majority of public services and commercial institutions are replacing the traditional mode of operation with electronic options , how can our society move forward with a sharpened edge with ict development and develop into a leading digital city in the world ? the issue of digital divide will certainly impact gravely on the competitiveness of hong kong in the information age . when the " digitally poor " fail to keep pace with ict development , they cannot become members of the working population in a knowledge - based economy , and thus cannot be among our consumers . in other words , society would suffer a loss in terms of their potential talents , manpower resources , and the contributions that these people may bring about . in any case , the sustainable development of hong kong as a whole will be adversely affected . moreover , digital divide is actually derived from the polarization between the rich and the poor . if the disadvantageous groups should be further abandoned by society because of their inability to master ict , the problem of polarization between the rich and the poor would be aggravated . on the other hand , if the disadvantageous groups could make proper use of ict , these people who used to be alienated by society would be able to obtain information , participate in cultural activities and access to employment opportunities , thereby widening their field of vision and improving their economic position . at present , the actions taken by the administration to tackle the issue of digital divide are rather passive , while the various measures adopted are also too piecemeal to achieve any visible results . indeed , the government has never conducted any comprehensive research into the difficulties the disadvantageous groups have encountered in using ict or their needs in this respect , to say nothing of formulating a independent digital divide policy . i hereby urge the administration to make as its objective the establishment of a " digital inclusive community " and expeditiously formulate strategies and relevant measures to enable the people of hong kong to make use of ict , regardless of whether they are at home , at school , using public facilities , at work , or even participating in various kinds of public and business activities . in addition , they should also be enabled to acquire sufficient ict skills and knowledge to obtain the information they need from the internet . apart from that , i also urge the administration to formulate a clear policy on bridging the digital divide , so as to ensure that the policies on ict can co - ordinate with other policies . at the same time , the administration should also develop a set of benchmarks - such as digital divide index - to review the information awareness of the people of hong kong , improve our rate of progress in this connection , as well as make comparisons with the digital divide situation in other countries of the world . actually , there are many ways to eliminate the digital hurdle , but our government must co-operate whole - heartedly with the business sector and the non - profit - making bodies in order to bring about a " digital embracing community " . as such , the administration should actively invite relevant government departments , as well as representatives of private and non - profit - making bodies to look into , concern themselves with and implement measures to close the digital divide . madam president , certain banks have recently started to charge minor depositors on the various services provided at counters on the one hand , and further promote their free automatic teller machine and electronic - banking ( e - banking ) services to cut back on administration costs on the other . as a matter of fact , automatic teller machine and e - banking services are convenient and less expensive . yet , to many elderly persons , people with disabilities , or other people who do not know how to use such services , they are being deprived of rather than being given the chance of enjoying the benefits of these services . the purpose of developing ict is to improve the quality of life of all members of society rather than causing more obstacles to their lives . i hope the government can collaborate with businesses and non - profit - making bodies to create a mutually adjusted environment to help close the digital gap , so that the benefits of ict can be reflected more expeditiously and effectively , thereby developing hong kong into a " digital embracing society " . madam president , i so submit . mr sin chung - kai moved the following motion : ( translation ) " that this council urges the government to explore and examine the issue of the digital divide in hong kong and to expeditiously formulate effective policies and measures , in order to promote the co-operation among private enterprises , charitable and non - profit - making bodies and government departments in bridging the digital divide and assisting the disadvantaged groups in assimilating into the digital era . " president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by mr sin chung - kai be passed . mr howard young : madam president , hong kong is one of the advanced economies in the asia - pacific region . according to the household survey conducted by the census and statistics department in march last year , the personal computer penetration and internet surfer rates among families in hong kong are 50% and 36% respectively , which should be considered acceptable in the asia - pacific region . however , for those families with income less than $10,000 a month , the corresponding rates are only 15.3% and 7.7% respectively . further still , because of education or other special reasons , some members of society , such as elderly persons , people with disabilities , housewives and new arrivals , can hardly have a chance to come into contact with , and to learn to use , information and communication technologies , and thus become the so - called victims of digital divide . the government should therefore square up to the issue of digital divide and take the lead in helping the disadvantaged groups to learn to use information technology ( it ) . it is the opinion of the liberal party that the government could introduce different measures to encourage the it and commercial sectors to join hands with voluntary agencies in making good use of existing resources to provide the disadvantaged groups with assistance in such aspects as material support , software , technological support and training . for example , the government may organize a computer recycling or give - away campaign by first offering incentives to encourage businesses to donate their computer and appliances that need to be replaced by delivering them to venues provided by voluntary agencies , and then properly recycle the donated appliances to people with the needs . the present problem is that even though businesses have such appliances for giving away , they do not know to whom they can give the appliances away . if the government can play the role as middleman and do the necessary liaison work , it will be easy to achieve the purpose of making good use of the existing resources without the need to allocate huge amount of funds . apart from that , the government can also provide voluntary agencies with subsidies to invite members of the it sector to teach the disadvantageous groups basic computer knowledge , thereby resolving the digital divide issue among the low - income groups . we understand that the government is now sparing no efforts in forging ahead with its digital 21 it strategy ; besides , it is also implementing a community cyberpoint project to equip community centres , town halls and public libraries with a total of approximately 2 250 computers for use by members of the public free of charge and for their internet surfing . besides , the super cyber centre to be opened by the home affairs department soon will also provide 100 personal computers connected for internet purpose , which members of the public may use for free . in our view , while it is a good idea for the government to offer the public more opportunities to use it through the provision of personal computers , care must be taken to ensure that the facilities are put into proper use . for example , the opening hours of the venues concerned should be better co-ordinated to enable the public to use the facilities on public holidays , or volunteers should be stationed at the venues to teach users basic it knowledge . these are measures the government should take into serious consideration . with regard to the digital divide facing people with disabilities , the visually impaired , for example , because they really have difficulty in acquiring , using and reading information , they are much handicapped in making use of it to obtain information . to tackle the problem , we suggest that the government should first improve its various web pages , with a view to making it easier for people with disabilities to use and browse the websites concerned . in addition , the government may also install specially designed facilities such as large print visual display unit , brailler , speech simulation software and large flat lcd monitor at community digital stations for the blind and the visually impaired . they will certainly find these facilities helpful . as regards private companies and organizations , however , we believe that we cannot ask too much of the private sector . if the cost involved is not too high , the government may in fact encourage relevant producers to look into ways to improve their websites . we cannot , however , ask the government to require the it sector to fully meet the different needs of people with disabilities when developing web pages and new software . actually , the government may as well consider discussing with suppliers of aid facilities for people with disabilities over bulk purchase of relevant facilities at discount prices or providing subsidies to enable people with disabilities to purchase suitable software or hardware at lower costs , with a view to eliminating the digital divide for people with disabilities in the long run . madam president , as a measure to receive the information age and to resolve the issue of digital divide , the government must step up its publicity efforts to help establishing a culture of it application among the people of hong kong . siding with the efforts made by the government , our society should also take on its responsibility to provide assistance for the disadvantageous groups in the community , safeguard their civil rights , as well as protect their abilities to act independently . i so submit and support the motion on behalf of the liberal party . mr yeung yiu - chung : madam president , with information technology ( it ) developing by leaps and bounds , the issue of digital divide is becoming increasingly visible . this will very easily give rise to a situation where the poor are getting poorer while the rich are getting richer , thereby causing society to gradually divide into confronting sectors . in particular , as they lack it knowledge and skills , the disadvantageous groups in society may lose their jobs and confidence , communicate less with the surrounding environment , and slowly , they may even become afraid of coming into contact with the community . they will eventually lose all their defence and become victims of it development . a present , the government has already set up a number of channels to provide services for the needy sectors . however , since the it needs of the disadvantageous groups are different from that of other sectors , the government should not apply the same measures to them indiscriminately . rather , it should first review the existing measures concerned . the location and distribution of community digital stations , for example , will also directly affect people 's interest in using the facilities . one important purpose of the digital stations is to encourage people to use computers . that being the case , rather than concentrating all the computers in one large area , it should be better to provide them at different places for the convenience of the public . public libraries , town halls , district offices , post offices , as well as other service agencies should be considered for such a purpose . a comprehensive review of the existing policy on closing the digital divide is compulsory and urgently needed , and we can draw on the experience of some advanced countries for reference . for example , the united states , which has a higher digital inclusion rate than hong kong , has released reports on similar investigations and reviews conducted in this respect . in october last year , the country released its fourth report in the " falling through the net " series , setting out clearly the achievements made in different stages and aspects , the problems that still need to be dealt with , and a number of proposed new measures made subsequent to concrete analyses . in addition to conducting reviews , we can see that other countries are also taking proactive actions in resolving the digital divide issue . in february this year , the former president clinton of the united states announced an extensive programme which included compiling budgets of : us $2 billion for tax concession purposes to encourage non - government organizations to donate computers , set up community network , provide training technology application for employees , and so on ; us $100 million for setting up a total of 1 000 community technology centers in low - income urban and rural areas ; and us $50 million for helping the public sector to establish partnership with non-government organizations to increase sharply the chance of low - income families to have access to computers and the internet . taking singapore as an example , he singaporean government provides second - hand computers equipped with free internet access facilities and basic training for 30 000 household users with an integrated income of less than s $2,000 ( approximately hk $4,600 ) , and at the same time offers tax concession to service providers and other relevant organizations which have donated such facilities . further still , the country also introduces an easy payment loan scheme to help its people with visual impairments to borrow as much as 75% of the cost for the equipment concerned at a nominal interest rate of 1%. as regards taiwan , it has already formulated a full set of policies to promote the development of a knowledge - based economy , including measures to assist the disadvantageous groups in assimilating into the new economy , such as researches into the practical needs of different sectors in the knowledge - based new economy . the government should proactively make an effort to narrow down the digital divide by drawing on the successful experience of other countries to remedy our shortcomings . in the long run , widely increasing people 's access to computers and internet facilities , developing a system of it education and promoting the concept of lifelong learning should be the most thorough methods to resolve the digital divide issue . that being the case , choosing the right government department to deal with the digital divide issue is also of crucial importance . in the past , matters relating to the polarization between the rich and the poor used to be tackled under the leadership of the social welfare department ( swd ) . however , if the efforts to bridge the digital divide should still be lead by the swd , i am afraid the policy concerned would become a passive assistance policy aiming at providing people with assistance to cover the costs for digital inclusion . from a different view , if society is to develop towards a knowledge - based economy , enhancing the it standards of the public is an inevitable long - term investment . encouraging the people to learn it is an important measure to improve their abilities in assimilation into the new economy and in securing employment . besides , the ability to make use of computers to obtain information can also help members of the public to communicate better with other members of the public , with the government and with society . all these will eventually contribute towards the progress of the economy . compared to the welfare approach which emphasizes the provision of assistance , this human resources development approach is more far - sighted . madam president , the pace of it development will not slow down just because there are people lagging behind ; however , it could still be bogged down by the resulting digital divide . we hope that the government will pay regard to the long - term development of a knowledge - based economy and expeditiously formulate comprehensive policies to deal with the issue . with these remarks , madam president , i support the original motion . mr david chu : madam president , in a society that features extensive it application , the disadvantaged groups , such as the low - income group , women at the grass - roots level , the disabled , the elderly , and so on , will be increasingly isolated from society if they fail to grasp the relevant knowledge in time . according to the government 's survey on information technology usage and penetration in the business sector , the computer penetration rate and internet usage rate among low - income households are far lower than those of households in other income groups . computer users among senior citizens and among people with low education and less economic activities also account for a lower percentage . in view of the adverse impact of a digital divide and a widening digital gap on the long - term development of hong kong , the hong kong progressive alliance ( hkpa ) considers it necessary for the government to address the relevant issues squarely by taking effective measures to bridge the digital divide and assist the disadvantaged groups , so that they will be able to share the benefits of it advancement . in this connection , the hkpa has the following proposals : firstly , to resolve the problem of the low - income group lacking funds to purchase computers and gain access to the internet , the government should vigorously expand the community cyberpoint project to provide the disadvantaged groups with computer facilities and access to the internet . secondly , in addition to hardware support , the government must also provide suitable induction courses for the disadvantaged groups to increase their it knowledge , thereby reducing their resistance to and alienation from it . in this connection , apart from stepping up it education in the context of employees ' training and retraining , the government must also inject additional resources for community education . thirdly , to effectively remove the digital divide , it is not enough to rely on the efforts of the government alone . instead , the joint efforts of all sectors of the community , including social service providers , private companies , particularly software and hardware suppliers and network service providers , are required in order to succeed . therefore , the government must foster communication and co-operation between government bodies and community organizations , with a view to establishing partnership , so that they can work in concert to bridge the digital divide . madam president , it development enables the entire society to make greater progress and offers more convenience for people in their daily living . the disadvantaged groups should be allowed to acquire more knowledge through this development in order to better equip themselves . therefore , there is every reason for the government to take corresponding measures and provide assistance in terms of its public policies . with these remarks , i support the motion . mr chan kwok - keung : madam president , in this information - led era , the development of society and the economy is it - oriented . to many people , accessing the internet has become part of their lives . it has also become an essential element in the pursuit of better living and career prospects . in fact , resources on the net have brought us considerable convenience . through accessing the internet , we can enjoy the financial management services provided by banks , and also through accessing the internet , we can enjoy some government services . these services , which are provided in a convenient and user - friendly manner , save us plenty of time . certainly , through accessing the internet , we can easily obtain the most up - to - date and fastest world news ; we can also use the e-mail service , which costs us less and is environmentally friendly . on the face of it , it development has indeed brought considerable convenience and benefits to people 's living . as it becomes increasingly pervasive in all aspects of life , people with it knowledge can obtain support for their living via many channels . it breaks down the time or geographical barriers and facilitates the more effective flow and spread of information . getting hold of information helps enhance economic efficiency and competitiveness . it can also improve the quality of our living . those who fail to grasp the skills early or find it difficult to grasp such skills , such as the disadvantaged groups of the elderly , the disabled and the impoverished , will be rejected by the world of it . hence their social status , livelihood and financial conditions gradually deteriorate . the rapid development of the information network has polarized the public . on one side are people having the resources and capacity to surge freely on the net ; but on the other side are people who cannot access the net for various reasons . according to a survey conducted by the public opinion programme of the university of hong kong as commissioned jointly by the radio television hong kong and the hong kong computer society aiming to gauge public opinion on electronic lifestyles , the people of hong kong in general have very limited it knowledge , while the general public is also shown to know very little about it . people affected by the digital divide mostly belong to the disadvantaged groups in society . they include poor people with low income , women , people with low education , people with disabilities or physical handicap , the visually impaired , the new arrivals , and so on . the impoverished people generally do not have adequate means to afford a personal computer . so , they lack even the most basic tool for accessing the internet - a computer , let alone surfing on the net to acquire various kinds of information . furthermore , a great majority of internet service providers only accept registration by credit cards . to the impoverished people in general , even though they have a computer , they still cannot gain access to the internet for they do not have a credit card . for people who are less well - educated , they may not necessarily know how to access the internet due to their limited knowledge ; and even if they know how to access the internet , the language barrier may hamper their reception of information , for most webpages now are still mainly written in english . to people with disabilities or physical handicap , it is very difficult for them to use computer and they must rely on expensive auxiliary aids . to the visually impaired , they cannot benefit from technological advancement , and their needs are seldom taken into consideration by manufacturers in developing it products . rapid it development has supported and improved our living in many ways , but it has at the same time created in society another gap between the rich and the poor . this gap may even be widened by the popularization of broadband . in fact , it development should be people - oriented , and it should base on the principle of fairness to avoid creating new social contradictions . apart from subsidizing the relevant organizations directly , it should also formulate corresponding measures for this cause . for instance , the government can consider granting tax concessions to the disabled to encourage them to purchase auxiliary computer devices . the government can also encourage its departments , in designing their webpages , to consider more about the needs of the visually impaired and people who are less well - educated in respect of the layout and words , in order to play a leading role and encourage various sectors of the community to have regard for the needs of different people in designing their webpages . moreover , in developing electronic public services , the government should plan in detail ways to take care of the needs of the disadvantaged groups , so as to avoid creating new inequalities , and should do its utmost to assist them to assimilate into the digital era and bridge the digital divide . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . mr hui cheung - ching : madam president , as a representative of the import and export constituency geared mainly to small and medium enterprises ( smes ) and a member of the small and medium enterprises committee , i am particularly concerned with the problem of digital divide faced by smes . according to the findings of the survey on information technology usage and penetration in the business sector conducted by the census and statistics department last year , employees of nearly 90% of large enterprises and 80% of medium enterprises in hong kong are owners of personal computers . more than 70% of large enterprises and 60% of medium enterprises are connected with the internet . however , employees of less than 50% of small enterprises with fewer than 10 employees are owners of personal computers , with lower than 35% connected with the internet . if we calculate on the basis of such data , the import and export industry is probably worst hit by the issue of digital divide . this is because about one third of the 300000 smes in hong kong are engaged in import and export businesses . of these smes , more than 80000 enterprises employ one to nine staff . if such calculations are close to the true picture , the competitiveness of the industry will be severely undermined if it cannot apply information technology ( it ) in time and provide its employees with proper training . this is not conducive to any attempt made by hong kong in retaining its position as an international trading centre . moreover , it will severely undermine hong kong 's economic development that is geared by re - export and export . promoting it in the import and export industry would not only fit in well with the competitive mode of the industry , particularly for smes which have very limited manpower but require demanding speed and convenience , but it will also help cut down on a lot of time - consuming work procedures . in recent years , the government has done a lot to reduce the industry 's resistance to it and its sense of isolation by implementing electronic custom declaration and organizing training courses for it assistants , and so on . with government subsidy , the hong kong chinese importers ' and exporters ' association , to which i belong , worked jointly with the hong kong productivity council last year and successfully developed a software system called " trade @ anywhere " to help the toy and general merchandizing industries to handle custom declaration , procurement , receipt , stock management , shipment , and so on , through the internet . however , as many it sales personnel are still not fully aware of the needs of smes , the software they designed has failed to cut costs and to effectively help the industry to promote its business . i hope the relevant authorities can continue with their efforts to subsidize more trade associations and develop more softwares that can cope with the actual business requirements . of course , smes cannot rely solely on one or two technicians to put it into full application . the administration must provide more incentives to attract smes to make productive use of it . for instance , i have more than once raised the point in this council that despite the offer of loan schemes by banks for the procurement of computer equipment , interest rates are still high . moreover , software is not included in such loan schemes . i think the administration can make good use of the remaining balance of the guarantees of the special finance scheme for small and medium enterprises to set up a loan assurance fund so as to help smes to install additional computer equipment and procure expensive software . this can definitely encourage smes to bridge the digital divide , to cut costs and to enhance efficiency in coping with the increasingly keen global competition . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . mr lau ping - cheung : madam president , hong kong has now entered the digital age . even advertisements put up by private homes for the elderly make great play of the availability of computers with which the elderly can enjoy broadband internet access service . it is indeed opportune for mr sin chung - kai to propose a motion on " bridging the digital divide " for debate in this council at this point in time . in an information era , all people are competing for the largest share of and the most up - to - date information . whoever wins in this competition can get hold of more information to improve their living . much to our regret , in this society of hong kong where free economy is practised , such competition does not start out as a fair competition right at the outset . some people who are better off financially would have their own personal computers and get started in the competition earlier . however , the disadvantaged groups can only gain access to this digital world at a later time . hong kong is a free society . while we accept its merits , we must at the same time accept its demerits . in view of this unfair competition , i agree that the government is duty - bound to mobilize social resources as far as possible to help the disadvantaged groups , so that they can have the opportunity to get in touch with the digital world and seek necessary information to bridge the digital divide . for specific measures , i believe colleagues who have close contact with the it sector or social work sector will provide more valuable input . i wish to raise one point for members ' consideration . but in recent years , this giant has consistently met challenges . its challengers , surprisingly enough , come from places all over the world . they are computer programme enthusiasts who have never met one another before and they do not even know one another in the first place . they have collaborated to perfect a computer platform called linux and other relevant software for free use by people . despite a tendency for commercialization of this computer platform and the relevant software , they cost a mere 10% to 20% of similar software by microsoft . besides , linux is intensely catching up and stands a good chance to outdo microsoft software . i cited this example in the hope of drawing members ' attention to the fact that assistance for the disadvantage groups is not necessarily confined to the paradigms that we followed in the past , that is , assisting them by providing funds , purchasing apparatuses or employing full - time it professionals to serve specific disadvantaged groups . in fact , the disadvantaged groups are made up of different communities , including the elderly , the unemployed , people with physical disabilities , and so on . they have different needs for information , and it may be necessary to specifically design some hardware or software for them . the past practices mentioned above may not necessarily be effective and may even lead to considerable wastage of public funds . members may recall that two years ago the chief executive encouraged the application of computer technology among tertiary students , and to this effect , the government had granted loans to university students for them to purchase notebook computers . but after the fad subsided , many students simply shelved their computers , resulting in tremendous wastage . in fact , many in the community are willing to contribute both their time and knowledge to help people in need . their potential cannot be neglected indeed . the it sector is no exception , and as i have just mentioned , there are computer programme enthusiasts who have worked in concert to come up with linux . in the past two years , a commercial radio initiated a campaign to collect old computers , and volunteers were recruited to refurbish the computers which were then given to people in need . moreover , some voluntary agencies have recruited a group of elderly people and taught them how to access the internet , and these trained elderly people are then tasked to teach other elderly people . from what i have learnt , the results are pretty encouraging . madam president , i believe that if the government can mobilize the people who are interested in serving the community by providing them with the set - ups and basic requisites and subsequently enlisting their services for the disadvantaged groups , it may produce even better results . with these remarks , i support the motion . thank you , madam president . miss choy so - yuk : madam president , the following is a joke that had truly happened . some 10 years ago , a friend came to hong kong from his home town to visit relatives . he watched a television drama series at his place and in the middle of the programme , he left to pay visit to another relative . at the place of that relative , he saw on television the same drama series , and he pointed at the television and said in profound astonishment , " this lady is superb . just now she was acting at my place and now she is here acting at your place ! " madam president , we certainly find such a case somewhat unimaginable now . as it advances rapidly , however , modern versions of similar incidents are actually happening on and on around us . four or five years ago , most hong kong people might just know little about such terms as internet , e-mail and webpage , or they might have never come across them at all . but in just a few years ' time , many people have become inextricably linked with the digital world in their everyday work and living , learning and entertainment . any secondary school student who says that he or she knows nothing about the above terms relating to the net will certainly draw inquisitive stares from others . web - based technology develops by leaps and bounds . if we fail to keep pace with it , we will lag behind others and will even be detached from society in a twinkling of an eye . e-mail has in fact replaced conventional correspondence and facsimile , and has become the most expedient means of interpersonal communication . more and more people are accustomed to staying at home and accessing the internet and interactive telephone systems to handle their personal affairs , such as payment for public services , placing orders for goods or services , handling personal finances , obtaining all kinds of information , and so on . even children will have to surf the net to seek information in order to complete some of their homework ; and during leisure , they will be engrossed in downloading a variety of computer games from the internet . if parents are ignorant of these new technologies and knowledge , a generation gap is bound to arise and this will affect parent - children relationship . madam president , while i handle my personal affairs by e-mails every day , i only have scanty knowledge of the digital world . so , i always say that i am " computer illiterate " . therefore , i have rather intensive feelings about this topic . no doubt the popularization of it can upgrade the standard of living . but it has one characteristic and that is , one will come across many texts , particularly texts written in english , in order to obtain information . for example , i have just received a pamphlet on digital divide distributed by mr sin among members and it is all written in english . besides , it takes a lot of money to purchase a computer and the relevant software . under the circumstance , elderly people who are less well - educated and who do not know english or the low - income families are likely to become disadvantaged yet in another sense . as a result , people having no access to it will be further marginalized . if society does not provide them with assistance to enable them to obtain it knowledge , they will be increasingly isolated from mainstream society and will be more vulnerable to discrimination . therefore , i would suggest mr sin to translate the pamphlet into chinese as soon as possible . most of them do not know english . coupled with their socio - economic status , they seldom have the chance to come into contact with it . consequently , they become fearful of it and hence resist it , thinking that all these are playthings meant for young and modern people . moreover , the gender stereotypes of men and women have made some in the community , even women themselves , think that knowledge of it , computers , and so on , should target at male . for example , the number of female students in it and science disciplines remains on the low side . furthermore , the pressure of household chores and the lack of adequate financial resources among low - income families are the principal factors preventing women from grasping it knowledge . for these reasons , initiatives to identify ways to help bridge the digital divide for grass - roots women are of paramount importance . for a start , the government must address the problem of insufficient resources . on the one hand , it should set up cyberpoints at more locations , so that women without a computer at home can have access to computer more readily . on the other hand , it must study ways to help low - income families procure computer facilities , and also encourage network service providers to offer concessions to low - income families . besides , women groups , voluntary agencies and community organizations in various districts have contacts with the grassroots most often and therefore know best about their actual needs . the government should make good use of this network and foster co-operation with these organizations to , among other things , organize more activities aimed to promote digital technologies at district level by , for instance , organizing computer courses , interest groups , and so on . madam president , i wish to add that the pricing of computer software and hardware is also a crucial factor for the digital divide to be bridged . as we all know , the market of general word processing software for offices is now virtually monopolized by microsoft , resulting in high prices of the relevant software . to break this monopoly , the government should take the lead to use linux as well , which has no copyright , in order to encourage more companies to use less expensive or even free software , thereby rendering the software market more pluralistic . only in this way can software prices fall to a reasonable level acceptable to the general public . with these remarks , madam president , i support the motion . dr raymond ho : madam president , according to the definition of the organization for economic co-operation and development , digital divide means the gap between people who can participate in and hence benefit from an information economy and people who cannot participate in it . computer access , internet connection and it application have gradually become essential to people 's living . at work , it application enhances our efficiency ; and through accessing the internet , we can grasp the latest information to facilitate our business development . in respect of our living , we can , without having to leave our homes , access the internet to learn about the current development in the globe , compare the prices and functions of commodities that we intend to buy , or chat with friends on the net and send e-mails to them . so , whether a person has the ability to fully participate in society will hinge upon whether he has the opportunity to participate in this information environment . like other advanced countries , hong kong also faces the problem of a digital divide at the same time as efforts are made to actively develop and promote it . as pointed out by the secretary for health and welfare , dr yeoh eng - kiong , in his reply to a question asked by a member in this council last week about supporting the disadvantaged groups to learn it , people with disabilities , the elderly , the low - income group , housewives and the new arrivals may have less opportunities to access information and communication technology . in fact , these people will not be able to avail themselves to the benefits and opportunities brought by it development for they lack the opportunity to have access to computers and communication technology . at the same time , they cannot enhance their competitiveness by grasping the latest information technology . compared to those who " have " access to it , these people are the " have nots " , and they will be put in an even more disadvantageous position . to avoid the further widening of the digital divide in hong kong , the concerned authorities should step up assistance for the disadvantaged groups to enhance their knowledge and application of it . for a start , the government should provide additional funding for community halls , libraries and other relevant public facilities in various districts to facilitate the installation of computer and communication facilities , with a view to enabling more members of the public to gain access to it and the internet . meanwhile , the concerned authorities should approve funding for voluntary or non - profit - making bodies to organize computer and it - related courses to help bridge the digital divide . on the other hand , the government can proactively invite the private sector , particularly computer and it companies , to partake in programmes to mitigate the digital divide . these programmes can include donations of or discounts for computer hardware , communication equipment , software application and internet connection service , and so on , so as to benefit more companies and people in need and help resolve the problem of digital divide . from the viewpoint of donors , enabling more people to gain access to computer and the internet will bring them certain tangible benefits too . first , the relevant programmes will help companies making donations or offering discounts as well as their brandnames become more widely known , thus boosting sales or usage of their services . moreover , if more people are well - versed with it , it will provide a pool of suitable talents for the development of these companies . for the overall interests of hong kong , enabling more people to master it will sharpen the competitive edge of hong kong and this will be all the more conducive to the future development of the territory . madam president , as the information economy develops in hong kong , we must at the same time exert ourselves to bridge the digital divide before all sectors of the community can share the fruits of development . with these remarks , i support the motion . thank you , madam president . president : does any other member wish to speak ? mr lee cheuk - yan : madam president , some have said that information technology ( it ) is another important technological reform in human history but according to the records of unofficial history , during the last technological reform , every member of the first group of people who caught the train of reform earned the first bucket of gold earlier than expected . their body shape suddenly changed , their waistline tremendously increased overnight and all of them had a large belly . yet , those who failed to catch the train became bony and skinny and they possessed nothing . as historians told us , the field was littered with corpses and there were disaster victims everywhere after the train of technological reform passed through . hager said that important historical events and figures often appeared twice and marx added that the first appearance was a tragedy and the second was a farce . as compared with the last technological reform , it had faster , deeper and wider impacts on human society . if the last technological reform caused a tragedy to human society , the motion debate today on bridging the digital divide is intended to avoid a farce . madam president , in our discussions about bridging the digital divide , the mainstream arguments ( including the motion debated today ) focus on how to assist the disadvantaged groups in catching the train of it . although this is important , i believe a similarly important but neglected point is that some people will fail to catch the train of it for certain reasons . to really bridge the digital divide and reduce the negative effects of the digital divide on the disadvantaged groups , we should try our best to prevent those who fail to catch the train from feeling as though they have been sent to hell forever , with no chance of deliverance . for example , banks have recently collected charges from the disadvantaged groups . depositors are not charged if they are familiar with digital and on - line operation , otherwise , they will be charged for using conventional counter services . it seems as though those who do not know how to apply it or new technologies would be sent to hell as they would be charged and " carved " . the second example concerns the protection of workers who fail to master it to ensure that they would likewise enjoy stable and reasonable employment . if the world continues to develop this way , a crisis will emerge whereby workers who can master it can secure jobs with reasonable wages , otherwise they will have to accept low wages and suffer . i hope to remind members not to forget all those who are responsible for cleaning the streets and collecting rubbish . although they lack it knowledge , if they suddenly suspend work tomorrow , the effect on hong kong would be bigger than the suspension of work by it personnel and the impact on the public would be deeper . thus , i hope everybody would think about this , a division of labour does exist in the society and workers who cannot master it should not have lower wages or remuneration just because they fail to keep up with the times . as regards assisting the disadvantaged groups to catch the train , i am concerned about how workers at different academic and technological levels could enjoy the job opportunities brought by it and how we could avoid the extension of the digital divide into the next generation . i wish to say that people 's criticisms about the employees retraining board sometimes made me unhappy . some asked since housewives do not have jobs , why do they need to obtain computer knowledge and whether it would be useful for them to obtain computer knowledge ? i think these comments are not very good . although housewives would not immediately apply the computer knowledge they have obtained in the market , they would have mastered technological knowledge . why should we regard them as having cheated the government of its resources ? i hope that members would be more open . if we really wish to bridge the digital divide and allow all workers and those who do not have a job to master it , we should not adopt such an attitude . at the first motion debate in the millennium , i have brought up that extensive it application by enterprises would directly strike a blow at middle clerical posts , but then , on another occasion , the secretary for education and manpower criticized me for exaggerating things and for scaring people . however , the northward movement of the data processing supports team of the hsbc proved that the above phenomenon had emerged . i always think that the tendency of extensive it application by enterprises may not be diverted by one 's wishful thinkings . there are many different proposals for the it application by enterprises and they do not necessarily have to move some units northward or scrap middle posts . i once again urge the government to set up a tripartite team and explore a proposal for it application and process reorganization that can accommodate and take care of the interests of employers and the different ranks of employees . for example , enterprises can gradually implement an it application scheme to match the progress of employee training instead of remaining indifferent even if employees fail to catch the train . they should not request for labour importation once they do not have qualified personnel . regarding computer programming and application interface and process splitting , they should try their best to take care of employees at lower technological levels to enable them to perform the relevant tasks . to avoid the extension of the digital divide into the next generation , i hope that the government would increase subsidies for the procurement of computers , application software and internet connection by poor students , with the objective of allowing each household with school children to own at least one computer that allows for internet access . some organizations are also collecting second - hand computers for distribution to poor students in need . if the government could take coupling administrative measures , the scheme could be carried forward and more needy people would be benefitted . lastly , i would like to emphasize in particular that we should never blindly worship digital application . if so , we would be controlled by the spirit of digital application and it would seem as though we could not do anything without digital technologies . i think that it would be better for the world to become simpler . too much information makes the world more and more complicated and causes a deeper and deeper alienation among people . i firmly believe that with less information , there will be more tender feelings and closer human relationship . there may also be stronger cultural flavour and taste and people will not only sit stiffly in front of the computer every day . i do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm of mr sin chung - kai today but i only hope that members would try their best not to excessively worship digital application . thank you , madam president . mr ambrose lau : madam president , a digital divide refers to the disparity between different countries , regions and groups of people in the mastery and usage of information technology ( it ) . for hong kong , the penetration rate of personal computers and the internet in high - income families is higher than that of low - income families , but the handicapped , housewives and new arrivals seldom have access to it . the difference between the penetration rate of personal computers and the internet in high - income families with an income of over $50,000 and low - income families with an income of less than $10,000 is 67.5% and 63.7% respectively . although the difference is not too big as compared with that in other regions , an accountable government should be prepared for danger in times of peace and become fully aware of the negative effects of an aggravated digital divide on the co-ordination and development of society and social stability . madam president , people used to pay more attention to the disparity between the rich and the poor in the past , but the digital divide in an era of a knowledge - based economy is more serious than the disparity between the rich and the poor and the impacts on social harmony and stability are greater . to a certain extent , the digital divide originates from the disparity between the rich and the poor , then an aggravated digital divide conversely aggravates the disparity between the rich and the poor , thus resulting in a bigger and bigger difference between the prospects of development and living standard of high - income families and low - income families . consequently , it is even harder for the disadvantaged groups to make efforts to improve their condition . madam president , the government cannot treat the digital divide lightly because it spreads extensively . almost 20 years since the upsurge of it , the number of countries categorized by the united nations as the most undeveloped has increased from 29 to 47 , people in developing countries living below the international poverty line standard has increased by 40% to over 1 billion , while over 600 million are living in abject poverty . i suggest that the government should also carefully investigate and conduct a study on the poor and those living in abject poverty in hong kong . on the basis of the statistics gathered by the hong kong social security society last year , a total of 440 000 households in hong kong secured an average income of $8,500 or less , and 166000 households among them secured an average income of only $2,000 and they were living in abject poverty . the problem is very serious . the government should attach great importance to the poverty problem in hong kong , it should investigate , study and analyse how the poverty problem has brought about the digital divide as well as how the digital divide has aggravated poverty . the government will then be able to find the remedy to the cause and adopt measures to bridge the digital divide , so that impoverished families and the disadvantaged groups can , through learning and mastering computer and internet skills , overcome the plight of unemployment and increase income in order to improve their living standard . madam president , the disparity between the rich and the poor and the digital divide form vicious circles but it is possible to shorten the distance between the two in a benevolent cycle . a successful example was finland in europe . in the past , finland lacked resources and it had a sparse population , a small market as well as average living standards and economic development . but since the 1980s in the last century , it education became universal and was developed in finland and no effort was spared to develop it , information products and industries , thus the finnish economy rapidly became a high - tech and high value - added economy . at present , the per capita gross national product of finland still ranks among the first 15 countries in the world , and as its nationals have generally learnt and mastered computer and internet technologies , the phenomenon of a digital divide has substantially mitigated , with the positive effect of alleviating the disparity between the rich and the poor . the sar government has all along vigorously advocated and promoted the development of it industries . it should follow the example of and learn from finland , a more successful illustration in the international arena . as our forefathers said , " aim high and you may attain the average ; aim at the average and you can only attain the lower level " . the sar government should know this very well . madam president , if hong kong is to bridge the digital divide , the authorities concerned should grasp the latest situation and new features of the global it development , and follow closely the changes of the times in respect of education and the development of information industries . for instance , in regard to the tendency of internet development , in a year or two , the information infrastructure would develop into a mobile internet , and a lot of regional and exclusive web - based networks would develop from communication networks into information and intellectual networks . " a portable internet for internet surfing " would come true very soon in the financial , economic and social aspects . therefore , the government should have the sense of urgency of bridging the digital divide and follow closely and adapt to the changes in the times . assisting the disadvantaged groups in assimilating into the digital era is closely tied up with urging the community to follow closely the rapidly changing technological innovation in a digital era . the government should expeditiously explore and consider a comprehensive and forward - looking plan . if the government is conservative or just follows the footsteps of others , it will certainly have to pay an enormous price for hong kong . madam president , i so submit . the president ' s deputy , mrs selina chow , took the chair . mr law chi - kwong : madam deputy , we started discussing the digital divide when the information technology and broadcasting bureau was established in 1998 and we were especially worried about whether the digital divide would aggravate the disparity between the rich and the poor . just now , mr lee cheuk - yan has made some remarks , and i wish to make some immediate response to the remarks . mr lee cheuk - yan has asked why the digital divide affects so many disadvantaged groups . in fact , there is disparity between members in this chamber in respect of the application of digital technology . for instance , i use the computer but some members do not and there is disparity between us in respect of the mastery of information technology ( it ) . however , such disparity does not create a divide because it is only a matter of choice . when we discuss the mastery of it by the disadvantaged groups , we have said that they do not have any choice in respect of usage owing to limited resources , capability and access . therefore , when we discuss the digital divide , we should deal with it as a matter of choice , and i have not asked everybody to thoroughly master digital application . however , in this regard , i once had a personal experience . soon after i told my colleagues in the university that i intended not to communicate with my colleagues in the form of printed letters in the future but would use e-mail instead , i received a letter of protest from a colleague written with a chinese writing brush . he stated that excessive computer communication would cause a lack of human contact and the loss of our traditional culture . thus , he had written the letter of protest with a chinese writing brush and he had certainly not sent the letter to me via e-mail . the obvious problem is that time and again , experience has told us that a digital divide will sometimes be created in real life and it may cause a wide gap and even reduce human contact . but if we can bridge this divide , digital application could eliminate the obstacles of communication . we very often find that the relationship between people becomes closer through such means as icq . therefore , communication on the internet has its advantages and disadvantages . a lot of young people maintain contact with their classmates or friends via the internet which helps improve their relationship . hence , digital application can cause the divide to narrow down . for instance , old people and their grandchildren overseas can establish digital contacts and the divide between two or even three generations can become narrower . thus , the it tool of digital application can make the divide narrower . we are worried that the digital divide would aggravate the disparity between the rich and the poor and there are a lot of examples . most evidently , the situation of young people with different financial capacity differs greatly . some families are well equipped with internet and broadband facilities and young people who grow up in such families are much better equipped for learning than those who live in cubicles . even if we give the latter computers , they do not know where they can put them . so , there is inequality in their opportunities for development . regarding the digital divide , we have to pay attention to the point that we should avoid the aggravation of the disparity between the rich and the poor as a result of the difference in financial capacity . mr lee cheuk - yan has also given the example of bank charges . my views are somewhat different on this because i think that charges for services are inevitable in the long run . as the marginal costs of on - line operation are lower , banks would wish to attract account holders to switch to using the internet . in the future , the collection of various indirect and direct charges by banks is unfavourable to those who lack knowledge of it . if the application of digital technology were just an alternative offered , and customers prefer paying more service charges than choosing to use on - line services , then there would not be any problem ; but it would basically be unfair if customers cannot choose on - line services because of a digital divide , as they are incapable even of accessing on - line services . thus , the problem lies in how we can mitigate the unfairness caused by the digital divide . in discussing the digital divide , we are looking at the issue of " posing power " from another angle . the digital divide will create an obstacle , but if we can overcome this obstacle , we will be able to enhance our mastery of knowledge and information which will be an important tool of " posing power " . for instance , quite a few old people have told me their on - line experience , and they think that they have more self-confidence in the world of it , and they think that they are keeping up with the times and they are useful despite the fact that they are old . perhaps some old people have difficulty in moving around but they can roam around freely on the internet and surmount geographical restrictions . for them , digital application has not created a divide or an obstacle , but instead it has given them more opportunities . another issue that comes with the digital divide concerns whether digital application is the mainstream . initially , we have held discussions over a cyberpoint , and from 1998 till now , i have made the point that a lot of disabled persons fail to use the services in a cyberpoint and they have to visit places specially designed for disabled persons before they can use such services . this is a hardware problem . i hope that every cyberpoint can be installed with a computer for disabled persons . if we consider the matter from another angle , the problem can be solved through software development . for instance , a lot of servers have software development programmes and we do not need to design the software on our own . in particular , there is some audible on - line information , so we do not need to install such software on our computers , and the developer does not have to tackle such problems that have already been handled by the servers . such software development is helpful in mitigating the digital divide and it will help improve on the issue as to whether digital application is the mainstream . lastly , i wish to add one point . mr lau ping - cheung has also mentioned microsoft and linux . one of the recent arguments is related to intellectual property and my views on this are somewhat different from those of other members . i think that respecting intellectual property is helpful in mitigating the digital divide and reinforcing the application of programme software in hong kong as well as alleviating the monopolization of digital application by certain companies . although we may have to pay more to microsoft in the short term , it is helpful in mitigating the digital divide which will be more unfavourable to microsoft in the long run . thank you , madam deputy . miss cyd ho : madam deputy , the development in information technology has brought about great convenience to people and improved our living standards . the government has promulgated the " digital 21 strategy " , with the aim of developing hong kong into a business society and digital city linked up by networks . government services have been digitized , bills of many public services could be settled through the terminals installed in the community cyber points , this provides additional means for the public to access information technology . however , we must say , the set - up of the terminals , if not installed with software that matches them , would have put the disadvantaged groups , particularly women , the disabilities or illiterate under the threat of digital divide . when we refer to the digital divide , it may not necessarily be the access to internet , job hunting , the acquisition of updated information or reading academic research papers , it could also be something related to our daily life . the use of the octopus card , the purchase of mtr ticket , or even the use of remote control digital recordings , are in one way or the other , forms of information technology . i am very glad that in the discussion we just conducted , we have eventually involve an aspect more related to our daily life , that of the concern for the small depositors . this is a very good example to illustrate that digital divide is , in fact , closely related to our daily life , and also it would make the poor become even poorer . we are all aware of the levy of charges by certain banks on small depositors recently , for when the deposited amount fall below a certain amount , the depositors will be charged for the use of counter service . however , the customers are given choices , they would not be charged if they would use the automatic teller machines ( atms ) . why would so many people dislike the use of atms ? some people are illiterate , they cannot understand the messages displayed on the screen . some elderly may be slow , they may have input the wrong data the first time , and after two more trials , their card would be withheld , and they have to wait for two weeks before they can get back the card . this best illustrates that the emergence of digital divide may not be the result of inadequate hardware facilities . you can just imagine , which company would have owned as many terminals as the few large banks and the two main banking systems , with so many in numbers and so widely distributed as seen everywhere on the street ? why would the availability of so many terminals still hinder the elderly and the illiterate from using them ? moreover , they are getting more and more unwilling to use the terminals . their concern is the misuse of the card would result in the seizure of the card and some two weeks of inconvenience . this reveals that apart from an adequate number of hardware facilities , the software as well as the overall design must also have to be very " friendly " . for instance , could the displayed messages be expressed in diagrams and not in words ? as the banks have already deployed staff to assist customers to fill in pay - in slips , would it be possible to have staff to assist and teach the elderly or the illiterate how to use atms ? if the card has been seized , is it possible for the bank to open the machine for the card or return the card to the customer within the shortest time ? in fact , the emergence of the digital divide is a result of whether the designer has considered from the point of view of the disadvantaged groups at the time when the software was designed , could the designer appreciate the fear and the remoteness experienced by those who do not know about information technology ? when we talk about digitized and electronic services , are we intentionally or unintentionally trying to upgrade ourselves to an aristocracy with the knowledge we have acquired ? just as mr law chi - kwong mentioned that the members on that side do not use computer , and those on his side do , it seems that the use of computers has a differentiating effect on the status of people . as such , would such a state of affairs unintentionally marginalize those who do not know about information technology ? madam deputy , we possess the technology for communications , which are very advanced technology for communications , but we also need to have the heart for communications , or we would have wasted the technology . these ever - changing technologies are innovated at a pace no one can follow , but it would , after all , result in increasing obstacles between people . madam deputy , after we have considered the issue of " heart " , we also have to discuss the issue of money . a set of computer is very expensive , and not everyone can afford to have one . as we have mentioned before , the set up of community cyberpoints and super cyber centre is well - intended , but it is just as inadequate as other government facilities . for example , the super cyber centre in yau ma tei which has only been operated for one year will be closed by the middle of next year . such a good project has to be terminated merely because the government will resume the land . it is a pity that until now , it is still unknown where this super cyber centre will be relocated in a year 's time . with regard to education , the government should also take into serious consideration the programme that every student is equipped with one terminal . at the same time when we encourage development of a digitized knowledge - based economy , we should also take into account how we can subsidize poor families to procure computers , and to provide school - aged students with the adequate facilities to acquire knowledge in information technology , so that every student are given a fair chance to develop . madam deputy , although i may have a slight difference in opinion on digital technology with members from the liberal party , i will still support the original motion . mr tam yiu - chung : madam deputy , recently i attended the apec high level meeting on human capacity building in beijing . when the delegates and representatives from different countries and regions spoken on the ideas and suggestions to strengthen the structure of human resources , they have also expressed their concerns about the urgent need to bridge the digital divide . they appealed to the governments of the member states to strengthen co-operation and allow different regions to develop its strengths to complement and benefit one another , thereby enhancing the human resources standards in all regions . earlier , the sar government has promulgated the " digital 21 " information technology strategy , with the main objective of strengthening different social groups the ability to master information technology . one of the major indicators of evaluating the success of such work is whether the policy can benefit the disadvantaged groups . to master information technology would not only relate to the competitiveness at work , it has also become a basic living skills in this digitized era . as more public services have been digitized , and industrial and commercial companies actively develop electronics services , people with low academic qualifications , the low - income earners and the elderly are incapable of mastering the skills and have thus been marginalized . the digital divide would eventually expedite the disparity between the rich and the poor . among the socially disadvantaged group , the elderly faced the most severe digital divide . according to the study conducted by the census and statistics department , within the age group between 55 and 64 , only 6.6% have used the computer in a year . among the elderly over 65 years of age , only 0.6% have used computer . there are a number of reasons why it is difficult for the elderly to master information technology . many elderly have not received any education due to historical or family reasons , in addition , the decline in their physical functions , cause them to encounter tremendous difficulties in learning how to operate the computer . moreover , most elderly are hindered by economic constraints that they are unable to install the required facilities or to take computer courses . i have recently received a complaint from an elderly who is almost 80 years old . he was rejected for his credit card application due to his age , and the internet service provider has also rejected his application since he could not settle his bill by credit card . this case seems to be utterly unbelievable , but it is what happening in our society . to bridge the wide gap faced by the elderly , the most important solution is that the government will provide the basic facilities , to encourage the common use of computers for internet access , and to promote the wide use of information technology . regarding the infrastructure , the government should work with various voluntary organizations and regional groups in the establishment of adequate community cyberpoints . in addition to the existing internet access in public libraries , more computers should be installed at community offices and community halls , to increase the ratio between man and computer , so that more elderly could have access to information technology . the government should strengthen co-ordination and publicity , and encourage information technology service provider companies to provide concessions to the disadvantaged groups . recently , various telecommunications companies have offered free information technology services , such as the pccw e - community mobile centre project . the government should consider offering some tax - reduction benefits to these companies to fully utilize the capacity of private enterprises , and work together to bridge the digital divide . moreover , the government should conduct a study on the feasibility of allowing the families which receive comprehensive social security assistance ( cssa ) to apply for the information technology subsidy according to their need , to purchase computers and access to the internet . regarding capacity building , the government should organize more information technology and computer literacy projects . the computer courses provided by the government at present are too short in time , the time for the elderly to access to the internet is restricted to only four hours , which as the colloquialism goes , only " reaches to the throat but not to the lungs " . i hope that the government would make available sufficient resources to assist the elderly to learn about the operation of computer . moreover , the government should support the grass - roots groups to organize volunteer groups to provide technical support to the elderly . madam deputy , only by bridging the digital divide could more people enjoy the advantages of information technology . with these remarks , i support the motion . deputy president : does any other member wish to speak ? ( no member responded ) secretary for information technology and broadcasting : madam deputy , first of all , i would like to express my gratitude to mr sin chung - kai for moving this motion on bridging the digital divide and to honourable members who have spoken today for the concern and valuable opinions they have expressed over the issue . i hope that the debate today will help to cause members of the public to concern themselves more with this issue . i also hope to take this opportunity to explain to members the policy and measures the government has in place to tackle the digital divide issue . the organization for economic co-operation and development defines " digital divide " as " the gap between individuals , households , businesses and geographic areas at different social - economic levels with regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies ( ict ) and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities " . with this broad definition , " digital divide " exists in every economy in some form or the other ; the difference is therefore in the extent of the divide . to look into the issue of digital divide , different economies are using the chances that members of the different sectors of society have access to and make use of ict and the internet as their assessment standards . hong kong is one of the most advanced economies in the asia - pacific region . our ict development is at the forefront in the region . hong kong has excellent telecommunications infrastructure . our personal computer ( pc ) and internet penetration rates are comparable to advanced economies in the world . madam deputy , although members who spoke just now have already quoted the relevant figures , i still wish to seek your permission to repeat them here . according to the annual household survey conducted by the census and statistics department in march 2000 , we have a household pc penetration rate of around 50% and more than one third of our population are connected to the internet . besides , latest figures show that our mobile phone penetration rate is close to 80% and tops the rest of the world together with countries in the scandinavia . as regards e - money smart cards , so far there are more than seven million e - money cards in use in hong kong . generally speaking , a substantial proportion of the people of hong kong already have the opportunities to access ict and the use of the internet . the use of itc in our community is comparable to many advanced economies and compares favourably with many other economies . as indicated in the results of a recent survey , for example , hong kong ranks second in the world in terms of the surfing frequency of our internet users . so , digital divide is less a problem in hong kong as compared with other places in the world and our people have stronger capability in the exploitation of ict than people in other places of the world . nevertheless , i must stress that it does not follow that the government of hong kong is not attaching importance to the issue just because we address digital divide from a comparative angle . actually , i understand very much that there is no room for complacency , and that we must never under - estimate and lightly dismiss the issue of digital divide . on the contrary , we should formulate appropriate policies and corresponding implementation measures to eliminate or prevent any possible digital divide among members of the various sectors of society . concerning the issue of digital divide , the government has formulated clear policies to tackle the issue . in our first " digital 21 information technology strategy " published in 1998 , we have clearly set out that one of our key initiatives was to create a culture and environment conducive to the innovative and popular use of ict in our community . under the " 2001 digital 21 strategy " promulgated last month , strengthening the hong kong community for digital exploitation is one of our key result areas . we hope the community can take advantage of the use of it in their daily lives . in order to bridge the gap or avoid the emergence of potential gap between various sectors of the community , the government has implemented a series of measures , including providing education and training , creating a favourable environment for technology diffusion in the community , enhancing knowledge and awareness , and developing e - government , to achieve the following objectives : - to enable members of the various sectors of society to acquire basic ict knowledge and understand the possible opportunities that ict may bring about ; - to enable members of the various sectors of society to apply ict in their daily lives ; and - to enable members of the various sectors of society to have the opportunity to enjoy obstacle - free access to and make use of ict . with regard to the measures to promote ict education and training , in the field of education we are actively pursuing the five - year strategy " information technology ( it ) for learning in a new era " launched in november 1998 to promote ict education in schools . this involves capital spending of $3.2 billion and annual recurrent spending of over $550 million . our objective is to enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning through the use of it . apart from that , we also provide teachers with training to enable them to attain a certain level of ict competency . we will also increase the use of it in teaching , with a view to ensuring that our future generation has the capabilities to process information effectively and efficiently , and develops the attitude and capability for independent lifelong learning . we have targeted to deliver 25% of the school curriculum with the assistance of ict by the 2002-03 school year . to encourage students to use the internet for self-learning , we have also provided recurrent grants to schools to connect to the internet . all schools are now connected to the internet and over 90% of them are connected by leased line or broadband . to help students from less well - off families who cannot afford to buy computers for use at home , a sum of $200 million from the quality education fund has been allocated to provide funds to secondary schools to buy notebook computers with free internet access for loan to needy students . moreover , in order to ensure that needy students will have free access to computers and internet outside normal school hours , incentive grant has been provided to schools to encourage them to make available their computer rooms and ict facilities for use by students after school hours . in the 2000-01 school year , about 560 schools have participated in this scheme . in order to enable students to gain early exposure to the use of ict , we will collaborate with world-renowned it companies , including microsoft , sun microsystems and hewlett - packard of the ict industry , to launch pilot programmes this summer to provide professional it training to students at secondary level . these training programmes will lead to professional qualifications which are recognized internationally and will help the students acquire state - of - the - art ict skills . this will give them a competitive edge in establishing a career in the ict field or pursuing future study in ict . we will also partner with companies like the pacific century cyberworks and compaq to organize a series of it summer camps to provide students with an opportunity to enrich themselves with knowledge and early exposure to it . we will continue to implement these pilots programmes provided they are well received . in this connection , we appeal to the sectors concerned , including the ict and education sectors , to adopt the successful pilot schemes , improve on or intensify the contents and use them in furthering their development efforts . this is to achieve the ultimate purpose of having these programmes organized and brought to a greater height by leaders of the sector who understand the needs of the market , so that students and their parents can have more options regarding the methods to acquire knowledge and skills of the ever developing ict . at the vocational training and employee retraining level , both the vocational training council ( vtc ) and the employees retraining board ( erb ) have organized many it training courses for the employed as well as the unemployed , with a view to better equipping them to assimilate into the digital economy . in this connection , the hong kong institute of vocational education of the vtc has offered over 3 000 it sub-degree training places in 2000-01 . each year , the information technology training and development centre ( ittdc ) of the vtc has also provided about 10 000 training places under its it skills upgrading courses for in - service personnel and it conversion courses for non-it university graduates . in addition , the ittdc has provided through the youth pre-employment training programme about 1 000 training places for the it modules in 2000-01 . as for the erb , it is currently providing over 40 000 part - time short - term basic it skills training places each year to help trainees sustain their employment in a knowledge - based society . also , the erb is now jointly running an it assistant training ( itat ) course with the vtc . this course targets at junior it assistant level . it takes about 10 weeks to complete the course which covers areas like basic it skills , web authoring , introduction to e - commerce , networking , and so on . the pilot course has received positive response from the market and achieved an encouraging placement rate for the trainee . in 2000-01 , a total of 900 training places were provided . we will continue to provide another 1 400 training places in 2001-02 to increase the supply of trained it manpower at the junior level . we will review the course in the light of market demand . on the front of technology diffusion in the community , our policy is to provide a favourable environment for ict to diffuse in the various sectors of society . market liberalization and competition have driven the prices of telecommunications services down to a competitive and affordable level . in the mobile phone sector , the availability of six operators and 11 networks have enabled hong kong to become one of the economies with the highest penetration in the world . in the fixed line sector , hong kong has achieved universal coverage for fixed line telephone networks . meanwhile , our broadband networks have covered all business premises and over 95% of households in hong kong . further liberalization measures are expected to enhance substantially the choice of broadband access to households and will keep the prices further down . to date we have a total of over 400 000 broadband internet connections . regarding public computers , in order to enable the general public as well as the disadvantageous groups to have more opportunities to use ict , we have provided under the " community cyberpoint " project and through subvention to non-government organizations ( ngos ) more than 2 200 pcs with internet connection for free use by the public at convenient locations around the territory ( including community halls / centres , district offices , public libraries , post offices , and government - subvented organizations and voluntary agencies ) . a super cyber centre set up at the former canton road government offices in yau ma tei with 100 pcs to provide free ict facilities , resource materials and ict training to the community has also entered into operation . we expect to increase the number of public computers provided for use by the public free of charge to about 3 200 by the end of the year . the home affairs department is now dealing with matters relating to the relocation of the centre in the future , and i believe the service will be continued . to enable the blind and the visually impaired to access computers and the internet , computers with specially designed facilities were installed at eight ngo - run service units . these special facilities include screen enlarging software , voice synthesizer software , power braille and large - size flat lcd monitor . we will explore the further development of this project in the light of response and operational experience . apart from that , 24 public libraries also provide pcs which have installed similar software for the blind and the visually impaired . to further encourage the use of ict , we have also launched the universal free e-mail service in co-operation with the ict industry and over 1.3 million free e-mail accounts have been distributed . to assist people with disabilities to set up pc workstation at home so as to help them find and sustain an income - generating job , a central fund for personal computers was set up in 1997 with an allocation of $1 million . to date , 63 applicants have received support . a grant of $3 million from the lotteries fund has been injected in march 2001 into the fund so that the scheme can be extended . we expect that about 200 more disabled persons will benefit . we are aware that suitable software products are of vital importance to people with disabilities in using ict . for this reason , we have been making an effort to provide funding for local institutions to develop software products for the blind and visually impaired . the " access with speech and braille " developed by the hong kong polytechnic university on chinese voice synthesizer software is one example . we will continue with our effort to encourage local institutions to develop suitable software products for use by the blind and visually impaired . as a measure to promote the awareness of ict in the community , the " it hong kong " campaign was launched in september 2000 . the campaign comprises a series of ict awareness programmes , the establishment of a dedicated " it hong kong " website , the introduction of an ict pioneer scheme , the organizing of district ict activities , and broadcasting educational and promotional programmes about ict on television . the purpose of the district - based ict awareness programme is to enable the public , especially those who have less opportunities to use ict ( such as senior citizens , housewives and new arrivals and people with disabilities ) to learn basic ict knowledge . so far about 18 000 members of the public have participated in this programme . we are now making arrangements for the 2000-01 basic ict awareness courses , about 5 000 places will be reserved for senior citizens and people with disabilities . in addition to the " it hong kong " campaign , the government has co - organized with other ngos various activities to promote the awareness and use of ict targeting at different sectors of the community . for example , the radio television hong kong produced in collaboration with the hong kong computer society a series of tv episodes entitled " it files " in 1999 to promote the use of ict in our daily lives . the government has also partnered with the pegasus social service christian organization ( pegasus ) and operated the " e - community ambassador " project which made use of a mobile facility to promote various government ict initiatives around hong kong at district level . the quality education fund has also funded the pegasus to operate the it training centre , mobile it bus and e - teaching aids centre which help train school teachers and students to use ict for teaching and learning . under an " opportunity for the elderly project " , the social welfare department has provided financial subsidies for welfare sector ngos to launch ict - related projects benefiting 13 600 senior citizens . the projects included basic training on the use of octopus cards , automatic teller machines , basic web surfing , and so on . these training courses are designed to suit the practical needs of the trainees . to bridge the digital divide , we will continue to develop new projects or co-organize different kinds of activities in collaboration with other organizations , including private enterprises and charitable and non - profit - making organizations , thereby enabling members of the various sectors in society to become acquainted with it and encouraging them to apply the it skills they have learned . with regard to the development of e - government and the delivery of public services , the government has launched the " electronic service delivery " ( esd ) scheme to deliver online services to the community 24 hours a day and seven days a week . members of the public can access these services through the internet or public kiosks installed at convenient locations . so far , e - options of more than 70 kinds of public services have been provided . this year , we will be rolling out more new services for the convenience of the public , including booking of marriage dates , booking of sports and leisure facilities , online sale of government publications , registration to sit for public examinations , and so on . to meet the needs of people with disabilities , the esd website is designed in conformity with the internationally recognized " web content accessibility guidelines " developed by the world wide web consortium . it also provides text only version for use by the blind and the visually impaired . the public kiosks are also equipped with touch pad for easy web page navigation and control by wheelchair users . in the further implementation of the scheme in 2001-02 , we will equip the public kiosks with large - size flat lcd monitor to make it more convenient for the visually impaired to access to services under the esd . to facilitate access by the blind and the visually impaired to electronic government services , we aim to enhance all government websites by 2002 in accordance with our internal web accessibility guidelines , which are developed based on the " web content accessibility guidelines " . these guidelines have also been issued to public bodies and government - subvented organizations for reference and adoption . the government has also organized seminars for the ict sector to enhance its awareness about web accessibility and to encourage the sector to take care of the matter properly . we will also work with the internet professionals association to organize a web care campaign to promote web accessibility to the private sector and urge it to address the issue expeditiously . concerning the question of tax concession , under the existing salaries and profits tax regimes , expenditure for acquisition of computer facilities for use in work or business operation is eligible for depreciation allowance . taxpayers who support disabled dependents are also eligible for salaries tax allowance which can be used to purchase equipment to improve the well - being of disabled persons . madam deputy , in addition to squaring up to the issue on the policy front , we are also taking practical measures to bridge the digital divide . apart from investing substantially in developing it in education , we have also spent close to $2.2 billion on the various projects and programmes i mentioned just now , with a view to strengthening the capability of the community to acquire digital knowledge and skills . madam deputy and honourable members , the government has all along attached great importance to the potential problems that digital divide may cause to hong kong . in this connection , we have drawn on the experience of the international community to implement relevant measures to help the various sectors of society to assimilate into the digital world . as pointed out by mr sin chung - kai , a public hearing was held by the legislative council panel on information technology and broadcasting on the 14th of last month to discuss the digital divide issue . with regard to the submissions we received from more than a dozen relevant organizations during the meeting , we will examine the views in detail with the government departments concerned and make response to the panel as far as possible . we will continue to strive co-operate closely with the ict sector , the academia , private organizations , charitable and non - profit - making agencies , and so on to organize all kinds of activities to help the various sectors of society to learn and use ict . but the government 's efforts alone are not sufficient . hence , we must call for the co-operation and collaboration with the industry and other organizations to jointly strive to achieve the target of strengthening the community for digital exploitation and making hong kong a premier " digital inclusive " city . lastly , i would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to honourable members and my support for the motion . thank you , madam deputy . the president resumed the chair . president : mr sin chung - kai , you may now reply and you have three minutes 45 seconds . mr sin chung - kai : madam president , i am very grateful to the speeches made by the other 13 colleagues and the response from the secretary . i am pleased to know that everyone cares about the issue of digital divide . i would like to firstly respond to a question raised by miss choy so - yuk . i can assure you that the pamphlet on digital divide would also be produced in chinese . it is only that it could not meet the printing schedule at present . i agree with the importance of bilingualism , and we would not discriminate against those who only know chinese . i have also heard mr lau ping - cheung promoting the use of the linux software . there are , in fact , a number of software on the internet , such as star office , are available for free download by those who cannot afford the purchase of computer software . madam president , the only thing i am sorry for , is that mr lee cheuk - yan has misunderstood me . i have never worshipped information technology . although i am the council member that represented the information technology sector , i have never worshipped information technology . also , i do not intend to , as miss cyd ho said , make the use of computer aristocratic . mr law chi - kwong and i never look at the issue from this point of view , but we do believe in one point , that there is a need for the popularization of information technology . i do not think we are capable of starting this train , and i do not intend to do so . maybe mr lee cheuk - yan thinks that he cannot grab the train , therefore he did not do so , but he still hopes that he can . i believe that the digital divide is not a problem which we can solve today . the problem may continue . atm , for instance , was a technology invented 30 years ago and has existed for at least 20 years . we can project that in 20 years ' time , everything as well as the services provided by the government would be different from the way they are . a number of government services have been digitized and are available through the internet . the situation may be different in future , or even an opposite to what it is now . madam president , i realised that there is also the emergence of digital divide in some enterprises . the digital divide in small and medium enterprises ( smes ) as mentioned by mr hui cheung - ching is also a serious issue . it is a pity that we do not have any officials from the commerce and industry bureau to respond to the issue of the digital divide among the smes . however , i agree that the problem does exist . madam president , i do not subscribe newspapers at home , but i read many newspaper everyday or on sundays . the extra cost i have to pay for this is zero , because i am reading on - line newspapers . if i purchase all the newspapers i read , i may have to pay for tens of dollars , now that i can read so many newspapers , i am paying a price much lower than others . such cases , as well as the use of atms , would marginalize two groups of people . our theme today is that whether we can solve the problem of digital divide in the long run . it may be possible that the problem would never be solved , but we could not ignore its existence . i have mentioned a number of measures in the book , but i do not dare to include them in the motion , as it may involve a number of controversial issues . a few other colleagues have made some suggestions to bridge the digital divide . among them many are worth considering . i hope that the government will exert joint efforts with other organizations to solve the problem . thank you , madam president . president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by mr sin chung - kai be passed . will those in favour please raise their hands ? ( members raised their hands ) president : those against please raise their hands . ( no hands raised ) president : i think the question is agreed by a majority respectively of each of the two groups of members , that is , those returned by functional constituencies and those returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections and by the election committee , who are present . i declare the motion passed . president : second motion : the avian flu incident . the avian flu incident mr wong yung - kan : madam president , i move that the motion as printed on the agenda be passed . in 1997 , we witnessed the bloody slaughter of hundreds and thousands of poultry , meant chiefly to stop the continual spreading of avian flu , which may be lethal . in the middle of last month , once again , we witnessed a similar bloody slaughter , with the aim of halting the spread of the much - hated avian flu . in a short span of just four years , there were two large - scale outbreaks of avian flu , which necessitated the slaughter of over one million poultry . for some time , people thus had no live chickens for consumption , and we have to spend millions of public money on helping those in the poultry trade to tide over their difficulties and resume their business afterward . as the saying goes : " let it be known where the god of plague wishes to go , and we will burn paper boats and candles to send it afloat " . with the repeated outbreaks of avian flu , we really have to explore very seriously how to send away this " god of plague " . hong kong is a tiny but densely populated place with sultry weather , where viruses of all kinds can grow and spread appallingly fast . so , if we fail to maintain proper hygiene standards , there is bound to be a much higher incidence of large - scale epidemic outbreaks . if we look at the procedures , we will have to admit that a system much more stringent than that adopted before the last outbreak of avian flu in 1997 has been put in place , for the chickens imported to hong kong from the mainland have to undergo quarantine several times before they can reach the retail markets for sale . that said , i must add that the poultry trade is not very satisfied with the performance of front - line inspection staff because they are lazy , and they lack any awareness of possible crises and a proper attitude towards their monitoring duties . to begin with , some unscrupulous poultry farmers will pass off chickens with unknown origin which have not undergo any quarantine as chickens with health certification . this is similar to the malpractice of some in the garment industry to pass off substandard products as goods with certificates of origin . the poultry industry has also pointed out that when chickens go through customs , both the hong kong and mainland inspection personnel will not bother to unload all chicken cages for inspection , and they will just inspect the chickens kept in the cages placed at the rear part of the lorry . madam president , while we see the need to perfect the existing quarantine system , we must also note that the procedures of transporting chickens may also cause the rapid spreading of diseases . during this period of time , the chickens will not be given any food and water , and they are kept inside cages crammed with other chickens , with practically no room for any movement . worse still , water will be sprayed five to six times onto them to lower the temperature . in this way , even " robust roosters " may become " diseased chickens " . besides , since there is currently an over - supply of chickens from the mainland , and also since hoarding of chickens in wholesale markets is not permitted , wholesalers of chickens have no alternative but to sell their chickens to retailers at very low prices . what is even worse is that the hygiene conditions in our markets are very poor ; so , the already weakened chickens , when kept in such crammed conditions , are particularly vulnerable to the attack of viruses . the pitiable scenes of so many dying chickens we saw earlier on were precisely the result of this . we can thus see that the recent outbreaks of avian flu have actually been the result of a whole chain of factors . the only ultimate solution should be for us to make all - out attempts to step up the supervision of quarantine work and improve the hygiene conditions of the various spots at which chickens are kept . besides poultry farms , wholesale and retail markets are the places where chickens are kept in large numbers . that is why recent public criticisms have focused on the fact that our markets have become the hotbed of viruses due to poor hygiene conditions and poor ventilation . it is indeed true that our markets are very humid and stuffy , especially in summer , and people will not choose to stay there for any length of time unless they have to buy food , because staying there is so very uncomfortable . this morning , i visited the market at yue wan estate . although no chicken was kept there any more , and although all the stalls were tidied up , it was still very stuffy inside . so , we can easily imagine that those feeble chickens kept in such crammed conditions would suffer even more . we understand that the government has reached an agreement with the chicken stall operators in various markets under which all stalls are to be cleared of all chickens for disinfection once a month . the dab welcomes this agreement , and it also urges the government departments concerned and the poultry retail industry to put in place a mechanism of regular contacts , so as to review the operational problems connected with shops selling live poultry and livestock . madam president , some in the community are demanding a central slaughtering system for chickens , arguing that this can effectively prevent any further outbreak of avian flu . even the government seems to be " persuaded " now . however , the dab does not think that this is a wise policy , and it also thinks that the advocates of central slaughtering must note the following points very clearly : (1) once the policy of central slaughtering is put in place , people would have to make do with chilled chickens , the meat of which is of a poorer quality . is this acceptable ? (2) the experience of adopting central slaughtering for ducks and geese tells us that if the same system is put in place for chickens , the entire poultry industry will certainly decline drastically . in that case , it is feared that as much as 90% of the 50 000 or so people who are now engaged in the industry would lose their jobs . since these people are all low - skilled workers with little academic qualification , it will be virtually impossible for them to switch to new occupations . does hong kong really wish to drive them into unemployment , forcing them to apply for cssa ? (3) central slaughtering also involves risks . since all chickens are to be rounded up for central slaughtering , any contamination during the slaughtering process , such as by sallmonella or faecal coliform , will definitely aggravate the scope of infection , and so will be the harmful effects on people 's health . so , is this really a perfectly safe measure ? (4) do we really have no other alternative ? madam president , we should not always think of central slaughtering as a way out so very easily . on 28 may , the dab submitted a representation to the guangzhou commissioner of the ministry of foreign trade and economic co - operation on the hygiene monitoring of poultry supplied to hong kong . the dab is of the view that if the sar government can implement the following 10 measures , a further outbreak of avian flu can be effectively prevented : (1) the establishment of a co-ordination mechanism in conjunction with mainland authorities on regulating the quantities of chickens supplied to hong kong ; (2) co-operation with the mainland in stepping up the monitoring of random quarantine for live poultry and chilled poultry ; (3) co-operation with the mainland in stepping up the curbing of poultry smuggling and the passing off of chickens not having been quarantined as those which have ; (4) establishment of a poultry marketing organization to centralize the sale of chilled poultry and live poultry ; (5) improvements to the ventilation systems of markets and the storage of chickens , with regular clearing and disinfection of chicken stalls to ensure proper hygiene and cleanliness standards ; (6) strict implementation of the recovery and cleansing of plastic cages used for transporting chickens ; (7) a limit on the number of chicken cages permitted to be stored in a market plus requirements on water supply and feeding facilities and rust - proof cages ; (8) introduction of a leg - labelling system for local and imported poultry to facilitate identification of their origin ; (9) removal of heads and legs from frozen or chilled ducks and geese that are imported , and a requirement banning the sale of live chickens and frozen poultry at one single stall , unless a refrigerator is available for the storage of the latter ; and (10) courses on the maintenance of hygiene standards , virus prevention and disinfection ( for those engaged in the processes of production , supply , transportation and sale of chickens ) . the dab has already circularized a list of these 10 measures on written form to all the members present , and now , i only wish to say a few words on the proposed leg - labelling system for poultry . the dab is of the view that the existing leg - labelling system is not satisfactory enough , with the result that we have so far failed to identify the source of the second outbreak of avian flu . therefore , we maintain that even chickens from local and mainland chicken farms must also be tagged on the leg , and that thoughts must be given to the possibility of labelling all chickens under a registration system for the purpose of identifying their farms of origin . this will not only enable us to track the sources of viruses effectively , but will also prevent the smuggling activities of illicit chicken farms . that way , people will have more confidence in the safety of eating live chickens . some companies in the industry have already made their own initiatives to introduce similar labelling systems ; subjectively , they hope to build up brand images through such a practice , but objectively such are the traces which enable the identification of the origin of their products . the dab maintains that the government should phase - in a leg - labelling system for the poultry industry . madam president , the actions taken by the government following the recent outbreak of avian flu have received the support of both the community and the industry , and these actions are much better and more decisive than those taken in 1997 . on the question of compensation following the slaughter of chickens , the government has also drawn up a scheme acceptable to all after listening to the views of members , the industry and the community . actually , the industry has been very willing to co-operate fully with the government throughout the whole incident , whether over the slaughter of chickens or the issue of compensation . and , the government has also been willing to take the views of the industry . so , i am sure that as long as all of us work with one heart , we will be able to solve all problems . i also believe that the whole poultry industry will assume its own responsibilty of further improving its operation , so as to restore people 's confidence in the safety of eating live poultry . with these remarks , madam president , i beg to move . mr wong yung - kan moved the following motion : ( translation ) " that , as the recent outbreak of avian flu in hong kong has forced the government to carry out another mass slaughter of chickens , thereby seriously affecting people 's livelihood and the operation of the poultry trade , in order to prevent as far as possible a further outbreak of avian flu in the territory and to ensure that the trade can continue with its operation , this council urges the government to : ( a ) strengthen the quarantine for local and imported poultry and review the existing process of poultry conveyance , so as to ensure that imported poultry meet safety standards ; ( b ) introduce a labelling system for local poultry to facilitate identification of their origin ; ( c ) improve the sanitary conditions and the business environment in markets ; and ( d ) properly handle the follow - up work on the current slaughter of chickens so as to reduce the impact on the trade and its operators . " the president ' s deputy , mrs selina chow , took the chair . deputy president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by mr wong yung - kan be passed . deputy president : mr tommy cheung will move an amendment to this motion , as printed on the agenda . in accordance with rule 34 (4) of the rules of procedure , the motion and the amendment will now be debated together in a joint debate . i now call upon mr tommy cheung to speak and move his amendment . mr tommy cheung : madam deputy , i move that mr wong yung - kan 's motion be amended , as printed on the agenda . madam deputy , in 1997 , avian flu attacked hong kong for the first time and took a toll of six lives , scaring both the government and the people at the mere mention of chickens . following the attack , the government and the relevant departments of the mainland worked out a system on quarantine , monitoring and prevention , which received the support of the poultry trade . very few people could have imagined that there would be another outbreak of avian flu four years later . but this time around , the government quickly decided to slaughter all chickens in hong kong before any mutation of the virus , thus successfully stopping the spread of the virus , avoiding any human casualties and significantly reducing the period with no supply of chickens . in brief , there are great improvements in the handling of the outbreak this time around . however , people would still ask , " who knows when there will be a third outbreak ? where does the problem lie anyway ? " where the problem lies is precisely the focus of the motion debate today . is it because the existing system itself is not satisfactory enough ? i must thank mr wong yung - kan for moving this motion , for it enables this council to raise all these problems for thorough discussions . i have moved the amendment on behalf of the liberal party with the main intention of introducing a greater number of specific proposals that may clearly alert the government to the directions to which improvements should follow . but we of course do not think that our discussions should be focused only on the proposed measures , and we welcome any other recommendations from the government and members . i am now going to discuss the recommendations we make in the motion one by one . following the first outbreak of avian flu in 1997 , hong kong and the mainland joined hands to work out a stringent quarantine system especially for chickens , and a " through - train " chicken conveyance procedure was also put in place , whereby a designated lorry hired by a hong kong chicken stall operator will drive straight to a designated quarantine chicken farm in the mainland after disinfection . then , the lorry will transport chickens which have passed random quarantine inspection to man kam to , where both mainland and hong kong quarantine personnel will conduct random quarantine inspection once again . following this , the lorry will transport the chickens to the wholesale market at cheung sha wan for " unsealing " before the chickens are distributed in batches to different retail markets . during the whole process , " through - train " conveyance is provided by the same lorry . the poultry trade accepts such a mode of conveyance , thinking that by doing away with the need for changing to another lorry in the process , it can reduce the chances of virus infection and prevent unscrupulous merchants from passing off chickens from undesignated chicken farms , or even " diseased chickens " , as those which have passed quarantine inspection . it is also of the view that in case any chickens are found to have contracted avian flu , this mode of conveyance can enable us to trace the origin of the virus and take appropriate measures to tackle . however , some in the industry have pointed out that this conveyance procedure has not been so strictly adhered to in recent years . chickens from mainland chicken farms are usually first transported by local lorries to shenzhen , and it is only in shenzhen that chickens are loaded onto lorries from hong kong for onward conveyance to the cheung sha wan wholesale market via man kam to . this worries the local poultry trade , for it is difficult to ensure the hygiene standards of mainland lorries , to ascertain whether the lorries have been used beforehand for conveying poultry such as ducks and geese , and to know whether this may lead to any possibility of cross - infection of the virus . besides , it does not rule out the possibility that some unscrupulous chicken farmers and merchants may mingle " diseased chickens " with other chickens and put them in the inner parts of lorry compartments . it is feared that if quarantine personnel are indolent and just pick the chickens loaded on the outer part of a lorry compartment for random inspection , then it will be very difficult to spot the " diseased chickens " hidden inside . that way , " diseased chickens " may get into the markets of hong kong . to avoid these problems , the poultry industry urges the government to hold discussions with the relevant departments in the mainland on the strict enforcement of the " through - train " conveyance of chickens , and it also urges both the mainland and hong kong to require their quarantine personnel to do their work seriously and systematically by picking chickens loaded in different parts of a lorry compartment for inspection . if necessary , the number of quarantine inspection should also be increased . second , there is also a need to maintain the stringency of the quarantine of local poultry . although the sale and quarantine of chickens sold by local chicken farms are under the strict supervision of the agriculture , fisheries and conservation department , local chicken farms are still permitted to sell their chickens directly to retail merchants without going through any wholesale merchants . should this procedure be improved ? mr wong yung - kan has already discussed this in detail , and i do not intend to do so any more . but i still think that the government should explore ways of improving the labelling system , and the most important thing is for us to ensure that once any virus infection is detected among the chickens supplied by local chicken farms directly to retail markets , we can always trace the origins . the third point . yesterday , when we met with the poultry industry and the food and environmental hygiene department , the industry expressed its unanimous support for a moratorium day on the 25th of each month for the purpose of cleansing . but it was also proposed that if the moratorium day fell on a major festival ( as in the case of the 25th of june this year , which is going to be the dragon boat festival ) , then there should be a deferment of one day . the industry hopes that after the resumption of business , if the government also thinks that this is practicable , the new scheme should be implemented . fourth , we should renovate and improve market ventilation . the general hygiene conditions in the poultry stalls of markets are generally very poor . i do not know whether it is just a matter of coincidence , but the fact is that all the markets in which avian flu was first detected this time , including those at fa yuen street , smithfield road and yeung uk road , are all managed by the food and environmental hygiene department . is this a mere coincidence ? is it because there is something wrong with the ventilating system of these markets ? is it because of other problems ? no matter what , the problems should be connected with inadequate ventilation , lack of fresh air and storage of too many chickens . currently , of all the 74 markets under the food and environmental hygiene department , only 11 are equipped with air - conditioning . in some of these markets , there is a very high density of chicken stalls . in the tai shing street market , for example , there are 36 chicken stalls , and 26 of them have been rented out . in the yeung uk road market , 24 chicken stalls are in operation . but for other markets managed by the housing authority , there are usually only several stalls in each . besides , in some markets with older designs , central ventilation is operated which can easily lead to the concentration and spread of germs . the temperature there is also very high . in some recently completed markets of the food and environmental hygiene department , such as those at chai wan , ap lei chau and sai ying poon , a new design is adopted under which all chicken stalls are grouped on one side of the market , and the slaughtering and ventilating systems of them are all separated from the main systems . this new design should be supported and encouraged . the renovation and improvement of market ventilating systems is a matter of extreme urgency , and the government should promptly explore the need or otherwise to apply for funds from the legislative council to rearrange the distribution of chicken stalls in old markets , and to install separate ventilating systems for these stalls , so that their ventilating systems can operate 24 hours a day . fifth , although the actions taken by the government to deal with the recent outbreak of avian flu are quicker and more decisive than those it took in 1997 , one can still say that it could have done a better job to tackle the aftermath of the outbreak . it is hoped that the government can consider the above proposals , so as to reduce the adverse effects on the community and the poultry industry . finally , i wish to remind the government and the poultry industry that hong kong is renowned as the " gourmets ' paradise " , and this is very much due to its emphasis on the freshness of food ; for this reason , chilled chickens cannot possibly satisfy the hong kong people 's desire for delicious food . if our reputation as the " gourmets ' paradise " is tarnished by avian flu , if people are thus denied the pleasure offered by delicious food , and if both the catering industry and tourism industry also thus suffer , then the community as a whole and the economy will certainly sustain very heavy blows . hong kong should not accuse the mainland , nor should the mainland blame hong kong ; wholesalers should not blame retailers , and retailers should not criticize chicken farms , which in turn should not shift the blame to the chicken conveyance trade . the problem simply cannot be solved that way . the mainland , hong kong , chicken farms , the chicken conveyance business , the chicken slaughtering occupation , retailers and wholesalers are all the segments of the same production line ; they are all interlocked and interdependent , and the inco - ordination of any one of them is bound to affect the entire poultry industry . that is why all these segments should really join hands to make improvements . there have been two outbreaks of avian flu . faced with the threat of avian flu , the increasingly high demand of people and the whole community in respect of market hygiene and the increasingly diversified range of goods sold by supermarkets , the poultry industry should no longer cling to its traditional way of operation . instead , it should adopt a more progressive attitude and do its utmost to promote higher hygiene standards among its members and in all chicken shops and stalls . all in the industry should join hands to improve the hygiene conditions in market chicken stalls and shops selling live poultry , so as to build up an image of our markets as places where hygiene is observed by both individual workers and shops in general . the hong kong government should step up its contacts with the relevant units in the mainland , and both places should strictly enforce their respective quarantine systems and the " through - train " conveyance of chickens . all in the poultry industry should join hands to prevent a further outbreak of avian flu by observing hygiene in their own areas of work . that way , people can keep their dietary habit and continue to buy live chickens in markets , and to eat dishes prepared from live chickens in restaurants . the reputation of hong kong as the " gourmets ' paradise " can thus be mainained . madam deputy , i so submit . mr tommy cheung moved the following motion : ( translation ) " to add " improve the existing operating environment of the trade and perfect the poultry quarantine system and the sanitary conditions in markets ; the relevant measures may include " after " this council urges the government to " ; to delete " strengthen " after " ( a ) " and substitute with " consulting the relevant mainland authorities about strengthening and strictly enforcing " ; to delete " local and " after " the quarantine for " ; to delete " and review the existing process of poultry conveyance " and substitute with " , ensuring that inspection and certification standards in the wholesaling and conveyance of chickens are enforced , and adopting a " through -

" deputy president : i now propose the question to you and that is : that the amendment , moved by mr tommy cheung to mr wong yung - kan 's motion , be passed . mr lau chin - shek : madam deputy , i am sure that the central issue of the debate today and also the greatest concern of the people of hong kong should be how we can prevent any further outbreak of the avian flu calamity . i am no expert in medicine and hygiene matters . but i still know that diseases caused by viruses such as h5 cannot be completely prevented . all actually depends on the random quarantine system for chickens - on whether it can quickly stop the spread of avian flu by effectively , promptly and accurately spotting the origins of the h5n1 virus . i understand that two quarantine tests are adopted under the existing avian flu surveillance system : the antibody test , which is conducted on chickens imported into hong kong at customs checkpoints ; and the virus cultivation test , which is conducted in random in retail markets . but the problem lies precisely with these two tests , because as pointed out by many experts , both of the tests are incapable of spotting the h5n1 virus promptly and accurately . i believe that all of us are aware that 90% of the chickens consumed by the people of hong kong are imported from mainland china , and only a very small portion of the chickens we consume is supplied by local chicken farms . that is why when it comes to avian flu surveillance , quarantine inspections at customs checkpoints at the time of chicken import should be of critical importance . the antibody test conducted at customs checkpoints cannot ascertain directly whether a chicken has contracted avian flu ; rather , it is a " roundabout " method which seeks to spot the presence of the avian flu antibody in a chicken as a proof of its contraction of the disease . but the point is that such an antibody will only be produced in a chicken five to seven days after infection . this is what is referred to as the " incubation period " . if , by the time the antibody test is conducted , a chicken has been infected for fewer than five to seven days , it will show no response to the test . that is why the passing of the antibody test does not necessarily mean that a chicken is not infected . during the course of conveyance to hong kong , chickens are especially vulnerable to virus infection because it is extremely crowded and stuffy inside their cages . since the conveyance journey is not very long , those chickens infected on the way may not have enough time to produce any antibody by the time they reach the hong kong customs checkpoints for quarantine inspection . as a result , the test may very often fail to identify the chickens with health problems . in the end , because of ineffective control at source , infected chickens may pass quarantine inspection and enter the market of hong kong . avian flu may then spread around , making it quite difficult to trace the origin of the virus any more . for the virus cultivation test used in retail poultry markets , i understand that the whole process will take three to five days to complete . since it takes such a long time to ascertain whether a chicken is infected by the avian flu virus , the virus will have spread around long before the results are available . therefore , it can be said that the two tests adopted under the existing avian flu surveillance system , that is , the antibody test and the virus cultivation test , are both plagued with loopholes . if the government does not make any improvements , it is simply very difficult to ensure that avian flu will not break out in the near future . last year , a research project with the participation of the hong kong university of science and technology successfully worked out a dna testing system for h5n1 ; it is understood that this research project is supported by the innovation and technology commission of the government , and the agriculture , fisheries and conservation department also took part in it . the agriculture , fisheries and conservation department has confirmed that the technology applied in the testing system is the most reliable and effective . unlike the antibody test , the dna test is a direct means of detecting the presence of h5n1 in a chicken , and it will take just a couple of hours . so , whether in terms of accuracy and time taken , it is far better than the existing methods used by the government . if this dna test , which has been explored with both government funding and manpower support , can really achieve quick and accurate results , then i would think that the government really has to seriously consider its full - scale implementation as a means of monitoring avian flu . just think about what is going on . once every three to four years , we have to slaughter all chickens , to spend millions and millions of our public money on paying compensation . the business of the poultry industry is seriously affected , and so is the livelihood of workers . worse still , the international image of hong kong is also impaired . we definitely do not wish to see any further outbreak of avian flu . with these remarks , madam deputy , i support the motion . prof ng ching - fai : madam deputy , when avian flu broke out for the fist time in hong kong in 1997 , the government launched a large - scale campaign to slaughter all the chickens in hong kong , and it also put in place a series of measures to reduce the chances of a further outbreak . but in less than four years , the government has been forced to launch another large - scale campaign to slaughter chickens . in the recent chicken slaughtering campaign , the actions taken by the government are much more decisive , obviously because it has learned from the technical experience last time . well , all the chickens have now been slaughtered and compensation paid , so , while some religious people , out of charity , mourn and pray for the dead chickens , we may also need to mourn for the $200 million of taxpayers ' money spent on the campaign and seriously consider how best to avoid any further large - scale slaughter of chickens in the future . i can still remember that following the first outbreak of avian flu in 1997 , the government put in place a series of measures to prevent further outbreaks of the flu in january 1998 . many of the measures put in place then are just the same as the recommendations made in the motion : first , identical hygiene standards for both local chickens and those supplied by mainland chicken farms , and health certification and random quarantine inspection at the time of import for all chickens ; second , a labelling system at the wholesale level and in local chicken farms to help identify the origins of poultry . the then urban services department also stepped up its inspection of chicken stalls to ensure proper hygiene standards . these measures are raised once again in the motion today ; does this mean or imply that all these measures have not been properly implemented ? what is worth noting is that these measures were considered adequate to prevent a further large - scale outbreak of avian flu by experts from the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention of the united states at that time . for this reason , we cannot help wondering whether these measures have been properly implemented over the past few years . how many chicken - mongers in a market , for example , would put on gloves and white robes ? is there any labelling for local chickens and those from the mainland which can help us identify their origins ? if it is really true that these measures have not been properly implemented , then what are the causes ? the inadequate hygiene awareness of the poultry industry ? the failure of the authorities concerned to implement the measures and monitor the situation properly ? or , are there any problems with the feasibility of the measures themselves ? i think both the government and the poultry industry should conduct a review , or else the $200 million of taxpayers ' money will be wasted for no cause at all . madam deputy , there has not been any consensus on the origin of avian flu . generally speaking , the following physical factors may all cause infection of the virus by chickens : conditions in chicken farms , the process of conveyance and conditions in markets . for this reason , any integrated preventive mechanism should take account of all these physical factors . of the three physical factors mentioned , the process of conveyance is least likely to cause infection , because there is usually an incubation period for virus infection . that said , we cannot of course rule out such a possibility . as early as the last outbreak of avian flu , that is , in 1997 , the experts from the centers for disease control and prevention of the united states already warned that the 15 types of viruses detected among poultry could spread very easily in chicken farms , and human beings might also be infected . besides , these viruses may first undergo mutation in other creatures and then infect human beings . actually , since 1997 , two new types of avian flu viruses ( h9n2 in 1999 and h5n1 during the recent outbreak ) have been detected , and this can prove the argument of the experts . it is definitely certain that crammed cages is a factor that can be avoided , and the need for regular cleansing of places where chickens are sold is also indispensable . the recent outbreak of avian flu has aroused renewed discussions on a central slaughtering mechanism . as mentioned above , the prevention of avian flu should require an integrated approach . although a central slaughtering system may reduce the incidence of avian flu , it cannot eliminate the disease in practice . it will not only deny the local people the pleasure of eating dishes prepared from live chickens , but , worse still , it will affect the livelihood of the several dozen thousand employees of the poultry industry . so , while it may be argued that having no live chickens to eat should not matter that much , it is definitely a different matter when it comes to the livelihood of several dozen thousand people . a central slaughtering system thus must not be adopted so very easily unless there are no other alternatives . there is actually another measure which can be considered . the chicken stalls in various markets may close for one day a week on a rotation basis , or they may just close for one day every 10 days , so that thorough cleansing can be carried out . those in the poultry industry must also enhance their awareness of hygiene , always keep their places clean and provide more storage room for their chickens . such a measure takes into account the incubation period for viruses and the fact that viruses will only have a few days to spread after their outbreaks . unlike a central slaughtering system , this measure can protect the livelihood of the employees concerned without creating too much inconvenience , for the local people and tourists will still be able to enjoy dishes prepared from live chickens . i think it really merits our consideration . naturally , i also hope that the government can co-operate more with tertiary institutions in the area of related research . back to the motion itself , it can be seen that some of its proposals are in fact meant to urge the government to put its past commitments into practice . these should of course be supported . however , as it is worded , the amendment seeks to delete the word " local " from item ( a ) . this may reinforce the impression that the origins of avian flu are usually the places of chicken export , and may well achieve the opposite result of reducing the poultry industry 's own awareness of the need to improve its hygiene and management standards . this deletion is also not conducive to our monitoring of the government to ensure that it will properly implement the various surveillance measures . another point is that there is actually no proof to substantiate that the mainland is the origin of the recent outbreak of avian flu . as a result , it will not do us any good if continue to intensify the thinking that all problems with primary produce are invariably connected with the mainland . so , i find the original motion more agreeable to me . madam deputy , i so submit . dr tang siu - tong : madam deputy , having learnt a lesson from the avian flu incident in 1997 , the government has behaved with extreme confidence this time . it no longer hesitated and with no clumsiness , it took decisive actions and carried out another mass slaughter of poultry before the avian flu spread to the full and jeopardized people 's health . although this made it more difficult to trace the origin of the virus , it at least reduced the risk of the threatening of the public by the virus . the government complied with people 's wish and increased the amounts of low interest loans so as to give the affected traders more capital . it also made the compensation in instalments to prevent irresponsible traders from deducting workers ' wages . evidently , the government 's remedial actions had a sound basis . although the government had aptly mended the fold after the sheep were lost , it could not be indifferent and ignore its responsibilities for the outbreak of avian flu again . the relevant market in the incident was actually managed by the food and environmental hygiene department ( fehd ) and the housing department . since the last avian flu incident , the fehd made public the sanitary standards of poultry stalls including the point that the ventilation systems needed improvement . however , the avian flu incident this time exposed that blood was found all over the poultry stalls and chicken manure was still found on the cages . it was the most disappointing point that among the 74 markets under the fehd , only 11 were installed with air - conditioning facilities , and some were even not installed with regular ventilation facilities because the authorities concerned had underestimated the flow of people and the quantity of poultry handled . the room temperature of these markets exceeded 40 degrees celsius , thus , avian flu is bound to break out sooner or later . the authorities just started to enhance ventilation in some markets in recent months and there was not any plan to improve the ventilation systems in over 60 markets . the government killed chickens before scrapping the two municipal councils , and it was said that the government " took advantage of chickens to scrap the two municipal councils " . it also declared that the centralization of power would help improve food and environmental hygiene . did the facts tell us that the government had properly managed markets that were closely bound up with the public after it had arrogated all powers to itself ? how many sanitary standards of markets could the government implement thoroughly ? the two municipal councils should have really died with everlasting regret . madam deputy , to effectively prevent the resurgence of avian flu , it was not enough to mend the fold after the sheep were lost but it was most important to introduce to the public and put into practice a preventive system with stringent monitoring and control in respect of import , wholesale and retail . the government should strictly require importers to establish a system for the registration of the place of origin of poultry and the date of import . it should explore the supply of all imported poultry by designated farms , encourage traders to separately transport poultry from different origins and with different date of import . it should also strictly require traders to control the density of poultry in a cage and step up random inspections to see whether the sanitary and ventilation conditions of traders are up to standard . quite a few traders had not suitably disposed of the slaughtered poultry . for instance , they had not put the slaughtered chickens into plastic bags or just scattered them around which created an opportunity for which avian flu and other viruses could take advantage of . the authorities should couple threats with promises and emphasize both education and punishment so as to urge the traders to understand that they might have to spend more time tidying up their stalls and keeping them clean at ordinary times . it would be much better than the regular resurgence of avian flu as they would then suffer great losses , caused a general turmoil would arise and a lot of public money would be wasted . in the meantime , the authorities should step up the random inspection of imported poultry , severely crack down poultry smuggling , establish highly efficient links with the quarantine and health departments of the major places of origin of the products as well as establish partnerships among poultry importers , wholesalers , sellers and the medical and health sectors . then , it could more accurately master the actual process of poultry management and take appropriate contingency measures . the government should also allocate more resources to explore whether we should import more advanced and accurate virus antibody testing technologies as well as assist the medical and health sectors in developing methods to resist avian flu . stringently implementing a labelling system for local poultry to facilitate identification of their origin could be very helpful to tracing and dealing with the possible mode of transmission of avian flu . yet , quarantine for local poultry could not be overlooked . although local poultry only take up a very small portion of our sales , the portion is fairly important . stringent quarantine for local poultry is an imperative measure to ensure food safety . the government has considered establishing a central slaughterhouse to collectively handle slaughtered chickens , i think that the idea can theoretically reduce the opportunity of the spread of avian flu in hong kong . however , why had two avian flu incidents taken place ? which poultry handling procedure was problematic ? these questions can still not be answered . if the government hastily sacrifices the livelihood of tens of thousands of workers in the poultry slaughtering trade and implement a central slaughtering system , it may see the disadvantages before the advantages . in my view , it is appropriate to adopt a compromise proposal first such as the " sales suspension day " as discussed by the trade . it was proposed that stalls should suspend sale once a month for thorough cleaning and sterilization . the government can also consider the designation of slaughtering areas in markets in which workers would slaughter poultry . this would facilitate the centralized monitoring of the sanitary conditions of the slaughtering areas and avoid the unemployment of poultry stall workers . all in all , regardless of the proposal to be implemented by the government in the future , the government should adequately consult the trade and the public in order to suit the remedy to the cause and balance the interests of various parties . madam deputy , i so submit . mr chan kam - lam : madam deputy , yesterday the government started to pay out compensation to poultry stall owners affected by the avian flu incident . the markets in hong kong underwent another major cleansing and work on testing chickens for the avian flu virus is nearly complete , it is expected that by the middle of this month , the public will be able to eat live chickens again . however , what is worrying is that when after some time when the avian flu incident is forgotten , people will stop talking enthusiastically about issues like improvements on poultry quarantine system and sanitary conditions in the markets . the lesson from avian flu which costs us $200 million will again be forgotten . madam deputy , not only is the recurrent outbreak of avian flu related to the poultry quarantine system and the labelling system , but sanitary conditions in the markets is also an essential factor . honourable colleagues who have visited the markets will know that sanitary conditions in markets operated by the food and environmental hygiene department ( fehd ) or the housing department ( hd ) , especially in the poultry stalls in the old markets , are all very poor . the first thing is that these markets have extremely poor ventilation systems and the temperature there gets to as high as 30 to 40 degrees celsius even before summer comes . it is no surprising that one gets suffocated walking in these markets , and more so would the chickens be . this is coupled with conditions like the narrow space between the stalls for shoppers , crammed poultry cages , chicken faeces on the floor and chicken feathers flying all over the place . things have become intolerable and no wonder when large supermarkets appear , the stalls in the markets have become no match to these supermarkets . of the some 70 markets operated by the fehd , only 11 are air - conditioned . before the reunification , the two former municipal councils urged the authorities to install air - conditioning in all of the markets in hong kong in order to improve the conditions there , but the progress has not been satisfactory . in a legislative council subcommittee on following up the work of the two former municipal councils , we have on many occasions discussed the issue of installing air - conditioning in the markets . despite pressure from the members , the government only responded by saying that surveys will be conducted in the markets to see whether most of the tenants will agree to bear the costs of installing air - conditioning before work can commence to install air - conditioning . from this we can see that officials are totally lacking in awareness of what the situation is like in the markets and they have no sense of urgency to improve on the situation . all they know is that funds must be collected before any action can be taken . on the other hand , every time when we visit the markets , the tenants will tell us that they want to have air - conditioning installed so that they can have a better environment to do business . madam deputy , our officials may only go to those markets with better facilities to do their shopping and that is why they have come up with such an impression of the markets . if they have the time , i will be glad to take them to the markets in kowloon east for a look , including those markets in shui wo street , ngau tau kok , ngau chi wan and tai shing street . then they can see for themselves what is really like to be in these markets which have made them become so notorious . madam deputy , mr s . h . pau , the director of the architectural services department , who is responsible for the building of markets operated by the fehd , admitted to the media some time ago that the existing design of the ventilation system in the markets is unable to meet practical needs . this when coupled with the wrong projections made by the government on the number of people shopping in the markets and the number of poultry there , have served to aggravate the conditions in the live poultry stalls . actually the design of stalls in markets is also a very important thing . in the markets we have , live poultry stalls are mixed with other stalls selling fish and vegetables . their size is small and the chicken cages take up most of the space in the stall , making the space in the stalls all the more insufficient . cages with chickens for sale have to be placed two or three feet outside the stalls . it is common to see empty cages placed all over the markets . that is not the fault of the poultry stall owners , but the design of the markets . therefore , the government should rectify this mistake as soon as possible . it should also take all feasible measures to improve the conditions in the markets . apart from improving the ventilation systems , the sanitary conditions in the poultry stalls are also very important . the poultry wholesale markets now have a certain disinfection procedure in place . this includes three rest days every month in which the markets are thoroughly disinfected . every morning and afternoon when business is over , the people there will disinfect the place to ensure germs will not breed and spread . it is sad to see that there is no such procedure in the poultry stalls in the markets where the sanitary conditions are even worse . the dab therefore supports the decision made by the government with the poultry industry yesterday that there will be a rest day for the poultry stalls on the 25th of each month so that cleansing and disinfection can be carried out . madam deputy , i so submit to support the motion . dr lo wing - lok : madam deputy , i am also speaking on behalf of six members , namely mr eric li , mr ng leung - sing , mr abraham shek , mr bernard chan , dr lui ming - wah and dr raymond ho . we do not regard that the government should be held totally responsible for the outbreak of avian flu , the aftermath and prevention , thus , we have reservations about the amendment and the original motion . there was an avian flu attack in 1997 that caused the death of six persons . after the incident , communicable disease experts confirmed through detailed research that men contracted avian flu after men and poultry came into contact with markets with poor sanitary conditions . therefore , if we wish to thoroughly prevent the outbreak of avian flu again and avoid causing the loss of life and economic losses , we must get rid of two harms , that is , unnecessary contacts between men and poultry as well as the poor environment of markets . on the basis of our experience in 1997 , the death of a large number of chickens would precede the transmission of avian flu to men . there was also evidence that showed that several victims had bought chickens at markets before contracting the virus . in some cases , children contracted avian flu after they had played before chicken stalls and came into contact with chicken manure under no protection . four years later , a large number of chickens in a few markets died of avian flu and the government have to slaughter chickens again . fortunately , there was no casualty this time . chicken stalls are found all over hong kong , kowloon and the new territories but they have different business and sanitary environment . highly conscious stall owners clean their stalls twice a day and their stalls can be described as the " show flats " of chicken stalls . however , some stall owners sell poultry in crowded markets and they cannot clean their stalls thoroughly , thus , their chicken stalls are the hotbeds of avian flu . in his motion , my colleague urges the government to improve the business environment of the trade , the quarantine system and the sanitary conditions of markets . for example , he urges the government to adopt a " through - train " mode of conveyance and the temporary suspension of sale by chicken stalls once a month for thorough cleaning . have we carefully considered the costs that the proposals involved ? after the avian flu incident in 1997 , the authorities spent a lot of public money to set up a stringent monitoring and quarantine system . owing to the objective environment of markets and some man - made factors , the monitoring and quarantine system failed to prevent the resurgence of avian flu . how much public money has to be spent if the government wishes to further strengthen monitoring , improve the environment and the facilities ? if the costs to be invested by the government are transferred to people who like to eat chickens , as in line with the " chicken eater pays " principle , i am sure the prices of chickens would substantially increase . would the public be willing to bear the costs of buying live chickens economically ? i would try to discuss the positioning of the live chicken trade in hong kong from a wider perspective . hong kong ranks among the three largest international financial centres in the world , it stands side by side with new york and london and is the centre of service industries in the world . although hong kong is a small place , it has a rapid and frequent flow of people . can a bustling international financial centre where every inch of land has a high price accommodate a large number of live chicken stalls at all costs ? we should carefully consider the direction of development and the orientation of hong kong . avian flu broke out twice in hong kong and this precisely reflected that some industries inevitably had to change the mode of business and keep up with the times in the course of continuous social development and transformation . taking the age - old industry of the sale of live poultry as an example , we cannot remain unconcerned about the mode of business of the industry , otherwise , avian flu may break out once every few years . does the government have explicit ideas for ruling hong kong and tackling the problems arising from continuous social development ? or , would it obstinately think of the taxpayers ' wallets every time and make concessions to avoid trouble , thinking that the problem can be solved satisfactorily ? as government officials and members who should bear responsibilities and who are accountable , we should not , with the occurrence of every avian flu incident slaughter the chickens at the first instance and then make compensation , because we would really have qualms about doing so to our taxpayers who remain silent and we would have overlooked the general interests of the community . although the community has the responsibility of assisting chicken traders in solving their urgent livelihood problems , in the long run , we should help them review their mode of business instead of giving them endless compensations which would urge them to invariably run business in the conventional manner . otherwise , the avian flu nightmare and hong kong would only be inseparable as body and shadow . after the reunification , we wished to have a high degree of autonomy and give up the colonial government 's short - sighted policy - making practice that treated only the symptoms but not the disease . this incident is like a mirror reflecting the lack of explicit ideas on the part of the government in ruling hong kong , inadequate courage on the part of officials and members to bear responsibilities , and the way that the public only knows how to protect themselves with a lacking in the sense of belonging . if things continue this way , it would be harmful to the future development of hong kong . the price of being short - sighted is the loss of vitality in the long run . i so submit . the president resumed the chair . president : dr lo wing - lok , i just resumed the chair when you started to speak . you said that you were speaking on behalf of six members . according to the rules of procedure , members could not speak on behalf of another member . however , other members can share you views , so my interpretation is that the six members have the same views as yours . dr lo wing - lok : thank you , madam president . mr fred li : madam president , the speech made by dr lo contained ideas ranging from the avian flu to principles on which hong kong should be administered . it surprised me . in a span of four years , the avian flu appeared twice . recently , experts from the world health organization made it known on the newspaper that they were worried that the south china region could still be a source from where the next outbreak of avian flu might originate . indeed , the south china region would also include the mainland , in addition to hong kong and macao . during the present attack by the avian flu , both hong kong and macao suffered the same fate . both needed to kill a large number of live chickens to check the spread of the disease . up to now , no one ( including the government ) can say with certainty where the source of the disease lies . however , we note that like us , macao relies mainly on the mainland for the supply of live chickens . so , it would not be helpful no matter how frequent the sar government conducts strict quarantine and cleaning exercises if the poultry trade does not discuss the issue with mainland health departments or urge the mainland to strengthen health controls . a third attack by the avian flu will not only result in numerous dead chickens , but will also leave the poultry trade confronted with immense difficulties . by that time , the government will be left with no choice but implement the central slaughtering plan . to reduce the chance of a further outbreak of the avian flu in the south china region , the government must discuss with mainland units . hence , for this reason alone , the democratic party will support mr tommy cheung 's amendment . the outbreak of avian flu poses as the greatest challenge to the government on its effective management of the poultry trade . thus , not only is it important that the mainland should do well in quarantine work , it is equally important that the sar government should minimize the chance of a recurrence of the outbreak and this should be an area of work that the government must undertake on a continuing basis . our government must do well in quarantine and health checks of poultry at the man kam to crossing , during transportation , at the cheung sha wan wholesale poultry market and in our retail market stalls . some retail poultry operators told me privately that chickens are very much heat - shy and would die easily . hence , local chicken farms transport chickens to the wholesale market at night to avoid the heat and the sun in the morning . chickens from the mainland , however , travel long distances in the morning via the man kam to crossing to the cheung sha wan wholesale poultry market . they have to wait several hours for a quick test result before they can be formally sold in the market . during the summer , chickens in this category stand a great chance of undergoing torturing heat in the day . thus , the government should discuss with the mainland to see if the mode of transportation can be changed so that chickens are transported at night to avoid the heat at daytime during the summer . when the avian flu attacked in 1997 , the government did a great deal of work . at that time , we thought it had done everything it could , including following up preliminary quarantine work at the man kam to crossing , conducting a quick test for poultry imported from the mainland so that poultry without any positive response for the virus may be distributed from the cheung sha wan wholesale poultry market to various retail outlets . moreover , all wooden cages were replaced by plastic ones . at the time , the urban services department formulated a set of sanitary standards for the then urban council and regional councils for poultry operators in their markets to follow . despite these measures , the avian flu returned and this tells us that the government still has a lot more to do to improve the situation . certainly , poultry operators have to conduct some self-evaluation because they are partly responsible for the outbreak . the avian flu this time spread quickly through our markets under the management of the district council . undoubtedly , the environment of our markets is conducive to the spread . we have in our markets dry goods , wet goods , live poultry , slaughtered cows and pigs and so on . all these are available in our market buildings , which is a feature of a hong kong market . it is precisely for this feature that we must establish very strict sanitary standards to enable our markets to operate normally . the amendment proposes to implement a system whereby the sale of live and fresh chickens is temporarily suspended in markets at intervals . from the newspapers , i learn that the government and the poultry trade have reached an agreement for a suspension of business on the 25th of each month for sterilizing and cleaning chicken cages thoroughly . in this way , chickens from old batches will not mix with those from new batches . we do support this practice . nevertheless , there must also be a corresponding improvement in the environment of the markets as a whole before we can get better results out of the suspension . i heard many colleagues mention the problems with our markets . i myself often go to markets and chat with stall owners there . i am also adviser to some market associations . i was told of the difficulties these owners faced . they told me from the markets in which they operate they find it very difficult to compete with superstores , which are equipped with air - conditioning and other facilities that make them comfortable places for shopping . take the market at tai shing street in wong tai sin as an example . i know the place extremely well . with 400 - odd stalls , it is a popular shopping spot for kaifongs , or people who live in the neighbourhood . however , the temperature in the market is so high that it is intolerable , for both human beings and chickens . before the scrapping of the urban council and the regional councils , they had a three - phase plan to install air - conditioning for all of their markets . after the scrapping , however , the government is only willing to install air - conditioning in three phases for 19 of the 80 markets managed by the former councils . the government could not tell us the number of years it would take to complete just one stage . as new resources have to be applied for , the progress is very slow . there is a subgroup in the legislative council that follows up the work and i am a member thereof , but we simply do not know how long it would take for the installation of air - conditioning in the 19 markets . moreover , we must not forget that 19 represents a very small number of the total number of markets managed by the former councils . therefore , i strongly urge the government to conduct a comprehensive review of the market environmental conditions , especially in regard to ventilation and flying dust . chicken stalls have a rather obnoxious environment . chicken droppings and feathers are everywhere . even if the chicken cages and iron racks are cleaned thoroughly , it would be meaningless if the air in the markets is foul . hence , we request that the government follow up improvement work in this respect . i so submit . mr lee cheuk - yan : madam president , dr lo wing - lok said just now that from this incident , we can see that the government lacks a philosophy of governance , for the government hastily proceeded to slaughter all chickens without bothering to give any explanation and then make compensation simply to pour oil on troubled waters . i believe what dr lo was trying to say ( i am not sure if i am correct or not ) is that vendors and workers are responsible for it . but i think every citizen is responsible for it , and i must ask : does it mean that the government has no responsibility at all just because we are saying that the public is responsible for it ? dr lo said that if we do not support the original motion and the amendment , it appeared to suggest that the government should not be held responsible , that the government has no part to play in it , and that the problem would be settled as long as the parties concerned do their jobs properly . i did not quite catch this point , and could dr lo please explain it given the chance ? regrettably , he does not have the chance to rise to speak again . but can those six members who support dr lo explain on his behalf what should be the philosophy of governance in your opinion ? what should be the philosophy of the chicken cull ? is it true that the government has no responsibility at all and that only the public should be held responsible ? this message is clear , that is , each and every member of the public should be held responsible . but at the same time the government should also be held responsible . the government 's responsibility lies in educating the public and facilitating the public to perform the duties expected of them . anyway , i believe there is certainly a common philosophy of governance shared by all in this chamber today and that is , no one would wish to see a third chicken cull . it should be the philosophy of governance that this chamber most aspires for today . looking back on this incident of chicken cull , while no conclusion has been drawn on the source of the disease , one can be sure that it has to do with hygiene . i have learned from the trade that the process of conveyance poses the biggest problem . chickens from the mainland are transported to shenzhen and then to cheung sha wan and finally to local markets . during the process of conveyance , chickens are crammed into cages . coupled with the sweltering weather , and what is more , i have heard that cold water is poured over the chickens when they arrive at the markets , chickens will of course be vulnerable to infection under such circumstances . imagine if human beings are put under such conditions - after hours of conveyance in an extremely crowded environment and being poured over with cold water from head to toe - human beings will certainly fall ill , let alone chickens ! so , the situation is all the same . how to prevent the recurrence of a chicken cull in future ? i believe we must first address the hygiene problems properly . if there is the chance to give effect to " poultry rights " , i hope members can make reference to the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , and apply some of the rights therein to poultry in this incident . article 7 of the covenant provided that the state parties to the present covenant recognize the right of " poultry " ( adapting " everyone " to " poultry " ) to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work which ensure , in particular : ( b ) safe and healthy working conditions ; article 11 provided that the state parties to the present covenant recognize the right of " poultry " to an adequate standard of living for itself and its family , including adequate food , clothing and housing , and to the continuous improvement of living conditions . i believe housing is very important to chickens as overcrowdedness will give rise to the present problem of avian flu . article 12 provided that the state parties to the present covenant recognize the right of " poultry " to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health , including the improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene , the prevention , treatment and control of epidemic , endemic , occupational and other diseases , and the creation of conditions which would assure to all ( " poultry " in this case ) medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness . i believe if we can really establish these rights for poultry , avian flu can then be truly prevented . such vehicles should be installed with air - conditioners and be allowed to clear customs through the express lane , and the chickens must be subject to stringent quarantine procedures . second , chickens from different farms must not be mixed up at wholesale markets , and chickens should not be kept for a long time at wholesale markets . third , many people have suggested independent slaughter rooms and that is , all stalls selling chickens in a market should be grouped together at a certain part of the market , separated from other stalls . the number of chickens kept by each chicken stall must be stringently limited to ensure against overcrowdedness , and there must be sufficient ventilation facilities or air - conditioning facilities that can suppress the spread of virus . if markets can conduct self-regulation and observe good hygiene standards , i believe the proposed central slaughtering system will be unnecessary . i oppose the proposal of central slaughtering for it cannot resolve the avian flu problem . prof frederick leung chi - ching of the faculty of science , the university of hong kong , stated that central slaughtering can neither exterminate the h5n1 virus nor curb the spread of any virus . he added that central slaughtering is meant to block all contacts between the public and chickens , but if it is not handled properly , it may lead to other problems such as bacteria infection . so , i believe if the entire chain system from transportation , wholesale to retail can observe good hygiene standards , central slaughtering will be unnecessary . finally , i must say that the compensation made to workers affected by the slaughter of chickens is regrettable . the environment and food bureau would not believe that i should make no mention of this point here . i always hold that the complaint mechanism is not feasible , although i have not been able to confirm it yet , for many chicken stalls have not resumed business and so , the workers still have not come into contact with their employers . once their business resumes and when both parties have contacts , we will have to see if workers will be stopped from lodging complaints . here , i must urge workers to approach trade unions for assistance first if they fear that they would be given the sack for making complaints . i believe the problem of compensation for workers can be resolved through the manoeuvres of trade unions . thank you , madam president . miss li fung - ying : madam president , in such a short span as four years , hong kong has twice been hit by avian flu . those in the trade , the employees , members of the public and even the treasury , have all suffered losses in various degrees . when compared with the avian flu of 1997 , there has been marked progress in the strategies adopted by the government to tackle the problem . decisive actions are taken from the discovery of the virus to the prevention of its spread . this shows that the existing surveillance mechanism for avian flu has been effective . the departments concerned have also made speedy responses and these are helpful in maintaining stability in society , protecting the health of the people and restore public confidence . on one hand this mass slaughter of chickens has shown that the crisis handling ability of the executive authorities has improved . however , on the other hand , as the ex gratia compensation is not sound and fair , the livelihood of the workers in the trade and the operators in the poultry business all suffered losses to a certain extent . there are members of the public who queried the way the departments are handling the incident . these departments have the mentality of trying to eliminate all risks and so they want to kill all poultry just to make sure that there is no risk . this is doubtful whether this way of risk assessment is a scientific approach to take . the director of agriculture , fisheries and conservation stated that no avian flu virus was found in local poultry farms and the decision to destroy all poultry was because of the fact that the sale of poultry in the markets had to be stopped for three weeks and farm chickens of an marketable age would have lost their market value . therefore , all the 1.06 million fowls in the 210 farms across the territory had to be destroyed . the number of fowls destroyed represented about 30% of the total number in the territory . can the departments concerned think of a feasible solution so that if a crisis of a similar nature arises , those uninfected fowls can be kept and then supplied to the public in a safe and sanitary manner , thereby avoiding a waste of resources ? on the issue of compensation arrangements , due to the fact that the departments concerned acted in haste at the initial stages , when the compensation arrangement was being formulated , no consideration was made on how to protect the rights of the workers in the trade . in the poultry cull in 1997 , there were some irresponsible owners who pocketed all of the ex gratia compensation payments . this time when the government is to formulate the arrangements of the ex gratia compensation payments again , no measures are taken to ensure that workers will not be treated at a disadvantage . that is disappointing . it is fortunate , however , that with the help of the parties concerned , and when the executive authorities are under the great pressure of the legislative council , a better compensation package has been proposed and put into force . that has minimized to a certain extent the impact on the workers in the trade . madam president , we get wiser with the experience we gained . the departments concerned should make a thorough review of the lessons learned from this incident , make a full - scale assessment of the risks and identify the areas that need to be improved . for example , on the issue of poor sanitary conditions in the old markets , can poultry stalls be segregated from other stalls and put in an area of their own , so that they will not mix with other stalls selling clothes or other things ? or about those sanitary standards on the placing of the chicken cages , the number of chickens in a cage , the operation procedures taken by the workers , and the requirement for workers to wear working clothes and so on , these standards should be strictly enforced . in terms of cleansing , not only should the floor and the chicken cages be cleansed , the ventilation and air - conditioning ducts and pipes should also be kept clean on a regular basis . chicken stalls and live poultry areas should have independent ventilation systems to make the air less stuffy . a special point to note is that after the markets are closed for the night , the air - conditioning and ventilation systems are all turned off , would that pose a great risk to the live poultry ? in addition , there should be strict monitoring of the transportation of the poultry and the sources of the avian flu virus must be traced in order that the potentials for an outbreak of avian flu can be eliminated . more importantly , when policies have been formulated , they should be consistently and strictly enforced . i hope that with the supervision and assistance from the departments concerned , the poultry trade can work together to improve its business environment , the poultry quarantine system and sanitation in the markets , as well as to take the preventive steps to forestall the recurrence of avian flu . it should also aim at minimizing the inconvenience caused to the public , the impact on the trade itself and the workers , as well as any unnecessary spending in public money . i so submit to support the motion and the amendment . thank you , madam president . mrs selina chow : madam president , i believe a consensus has been reached in this council that we all regret the recurrence of avian flu in hong kong and we do not want to see another hit on the territory again . i think we will work together to prevent avian flu from recurring . what has caused regret in us is that apart from the occurrence of this incident , there is also something which baffles us . after the outbreak of the avian flu in 1998 , certain improvement measures have been adopted in poultry supply from the mainland , quarantine of imported poultry and sanitation in the markets , but we are unable to know the source of the avian flu this time . some people say that avian flu started in the chicken farms in the mainland which supplied the chickens to hong kong . some say that the chickens contracted the virus on their way to hong kong . others say that the chickens contracted the virus after having been imported into hong kong and after inspection work had been done . it is hard for me to accept these explanations , for we already have the experience of avian flu and have since taken some preventive measures , but we are still unable to identify the source . it may actually be the existing arrangements we have that we are unable to locate the source . we know when we talk about the incident with those in the trade that many of the arrangements are beyond the control of the government and the trade . for example , chickens from different farms are gathered and transported to hong kong on vehicles from the mainland , then they will be put on local vehicles and transported to places in the territory . when the chickens are imported into hong kong , as the number is very great , even if sampling inspection is done , those chickens with virus may not be accurately and reliably singled out . hence the source of the virus cannot be located . nobody knows if this is really the cause . the poultry trade thinks that they have been unfairly treated . what they hope is that the problem should not be allowed to remain there until the slaughter of all chickens has become a necessity . the problem should have been prevented at the quarantine stage and its gravity detected then . once problems are found , they can be traced back to their origin . it is against this background that the poultry trade has proposed the idea of a " through - train " way of conveying the poultry . that is to say , the same fleet of vehicles should be used to convey the chickens , instead of having the chickens conveyed in different vehicles . what is the advantage of the former method ? the poultry farms in the mainland will use the vehicles in the mainland and the cost for using mainland vehicles is cheaper than using local vehicles . but why does the poultry trade in hong kong prefer to use local vehicles even if they have to pay more ? the first reason is that if local vehicles are used , there is no need to put the chickens onto other vehicles after they are imported into hong kong . this will minimize a certain degree of risk . the second reason is that there may be better control of local vehicles in cleansing and sanitation . having said that , the problem cannot be solved with the efforts of one party alone . i hope the government will discuss the issue with the mainland authorities on this proposal . there is also a fundamental problem and that is the lack of adequate transparency in supplies . we know that when avian flu first appeared in 1998 , we took a series of measures and for the following couple of years , we were very confident that these measures would be effective . however , in recent years , public confidence began to erode . people in the trade thought that the problem began to get worse because they found that the quality of the chickens could not be maintained . if people in the trade are having doubts and lacking in confidence , how can we expect the public to have any confidence ? the government should therefore think of ways to deal with the series of problems . i also agree with some honourable colleagues that some of our markets are really not up to standard . however , can the government absolve itself of all responsibilities ? the answer is of course no . i cannot understand why dr lo and those honourable members who agree with him that apart from the poultry trade , no one should be held responsible . as a matter of fact , the owners of the markets are the food and environmental hygiene department , the agriculture , fisheries and conservation department , and the housing department . these departments have failed to put the sanitary conditions in the markets under control . this is something we cannot accept . i think we all need to work hard on that . the poultry trade is aware that the public has reservations on centralized slaughtering and they know that despite the fact that theoretically there appears to be some protection in sanitation , centralized slaughtering does have many disadvantages . with hong kong being a gourmet 's paradise , the public here thinks that there is a unique flavour in live chicken meat and that is something which contributes to the quality of our food . if centralized slaughtering is adopted , many people will resist the idea of eating chilled poultry instead . that will also affect the quality of our food . this is something we do not want to see . the trade well understands that we all want to enhance the sanitation level and the people in the trade are willing to help and co-operate to solve the problem . they do not want to see the problem being described as something exclusive to the trade and there is no need for the government to care about it . mr michael mak : madam president , in such a short span as four years , avian flu has occurred in hong kong twice and the government is compelled to undertake a massive slaughtering of chickens . in these two operations , a total of $238 million was spent as compensation and ex gratia payment . in the operation carried out this may , most members of the public praised the government for its swift response to the crisis , but we are worried whether there would be a recurrence of avian flu in the future . at a time when public spending is reduced and the economy has not seen any signs of recovery , can we afford the hundreds of million dollars of compensation payments ? to tackle the problem of avian flu at its roots , the government has proposed to adopt the centralized slaughtering system to prevent individual retailers from handling chickens improperly , thereby triggering the outbreak of avian flu . i have reservations on the idea of centralized slaughtering . it is because it may not be the panacea to prevent the occurrence of avian flu completely . the centralized slaughtering of different types of poultry may also cause cross - contamination and re-assortment of the avian flu virus . in the end and as a last resort to prevent the spreading of the virus , a massive slaughtering of poultry may also have to take place . the result will be the same as the present practice of having the poultry to be handled by individual poultry sellers . moreover , centralized slaughtering will lead to certain social problems . for example , the some 2000 workers in the trade would be forced out of their jobs . some people may say that the government may assist them to find work in other trades . but it would be very difficult for these workers , many of whom are middle - aged , to find jobs elsewhere . centralized slaughtering would change the eating habits of the people as they can only buy slaughtered chickens in the market . they may no longer have a chance to see for themselves whether the chickens are alive and well before they buy them . in this way , centralized slaughtering would deprive the public of their right to choose . if the government can provide research findings to prove that centralized slaughtering can prevent the occurrence of avian flu , and that a scheme is in place to help workers in the trade to find other jobs , then i would give my support to the idea of implementing centralized slaughtering . to identify the source of the avian flu virus , a mandatory labelling system for chickens should be introduced . this will facilitate the departments concerned to identify the farms which are the source of the virus once the virus is found in the quarantined samples . in this way the other chickens infected in the course of conveyance can be destroyed and that the farms concerned can be barred from importing chickens to the territory . poultry stall operators should be required to handle separately poultry which is delivered at different dates . they should be required to cleanse the chicken cages everyday to maintain a good hygiene condition of their stalls . monitoring and supervisory efforts in importing , wholesale , transportation and in the markets should be stepped up . though this would surely raise the costs , it is worthwhile when seen from a long - term perspective and in particular , from the perspective of risk management . apart from hong kong , other countries have also been hit by avian flu . in order to minimize the adverse impact of the disease on human beings and animals , special laboratories have been set up to make a surveillance of the developments in bird viruses . for example , in harbin , china , a laboratory for animal testing in the avian flu virus has been set up . i suggest that the government should set up a research centre for bird viruses and obtain poultry samples from markets in different places of hong kong and from major farms in the mainland regularly for analysis . in this way the changes in the avian flu situation in hong kong and south china can be monitored . in december 1997 , the government announced that a new strain of avian flu was discovered . after a boy died of this strain of avian flu , many people with signs of influenza flocked to the emergency wards for consultation , causing a drastic rise of more than 20000 people admitted to emergency wards over the previous month , that is , november 1997 . in order that this kind of panic among the public can be dispelled , the government should enhance its efforts in community education and make the public informed of the causes , symptoms and serious nature of avian flu . in addition , the government should suggest proper ways of handling and cooking poultry meat . madam president , there are some honourable members who have said that it seems as if we are being too generous at the expense of others . i think they just lack a sense of social justice . first , no one has ever wanted avian flu to occur . second , after its occurrence , we should not try to pass off the responsibilities . if as members of this council we think that the government has not done its job well enough , we should ask ourselves what have we done as members of the council to monitor the work of the government . if the way they think and their concepts are always right , then there is no need for us to devise any plans to improve on the work in social welfare , health , correctional services and so on , and to work to improve the behaviour of the public and our culture or to eliminate what is unfair and unhealthy in our society . madam president , i so submit to support the original motion and the amendment . mr jasper tsang : madam president , an article advocating a complete change in the operating mode of poultry retail has this as its title : " which is more important - delicious dishes or people 's health ? " i do not quite know how to answer this question . many people do indeed wish to enjoy delicious dishes even at the risk of doing harm to their own health . however , many others , such as some members of this council , actually attach very great importance to a healthy diet . mr martin lee , for example , has been adhering rigidly to a healthy diet , which is why he is so very healthy . however , not many members belonging to the democratic party are like him . that is why the health of many the democratic party members is just like that of a " gastronome " like me , only that the conditions of their eyes are not so poor . the more advanced and civilized humanity becomes , the less likely that people will prefer health to gastronomy . we can even say that without gastronomy , the progress of our civilization will certainly become less remarkable as it is . we need not quote the example of those who eat globfish at the risk of their lives to illustrate this point , and if we simply look at the modern - day society , we can already notice that there are many delicious foods which doctors say are bad to people 's health . if people follow doctors ' advice of refraining from eating these foods , then they will probably find that there are many kinds of food which they cannot eat . the reality , however is not quite like this . madam president , the point i wish to raise is that the title of this article is actually founded on a wrong premise , because it looks at avian flu as an issue involving two mutually exclusive options : delicious dishes and health . what is implied is that if people wish to enjoy delicious dishes , then they will have to forego their health , or if they wish to remain healthy , they will have to give up all delicious foods . this means that they should stop thinking about buying live chickens from markets and consuming them . but is this really the case in reality ? is the poultry industry really in such a poor state ? is it really true , as described by dr lo wing - lok , that if the poultry industry continues to operate as it is , hong kong will be unable to bear the consequences ? during the discussions of the relevant panel of the legislative council , i once asked , " fire frequently breaks out in karaoke establishments , and people will also be plunged into great dangers if fire breaks out in restaurants . that being the case , should we just close down all karaoke establishments and restaurants ? " dr lo wing - lok said that should not be the case . i do not know what reasons he has , and it is a pity that he cannot offer an answer now as he is not in this chamber . according to him , fire and avian flu are of a very different nature , because the effects of avian flu are much more far - reaching . he did talk about $100 million , $200 million . only six people died as a result of the two outbreaks of avian flu , but the number of casualties in one single fire may be far greater than this already . so , how can we argue that outbreaks of fire are not important ? dr lo wing - lok wondered if we should continue to keep so many live chicken stalls regardless of the resultant costs . but we can also ask , " should we continue to operate so many restaurants and karaoke establishments regardless of the costs ? " if we close down all these establishments , the functional sector which mr tommy cheung represents will certainly be deleted . so , i think the logic involved is not quite like that given by dr lo wing - lok . we simply should not argue that if the live chicken trade continues to exist , hong kong will be plunged into deep trouble . one or two members talked about the outbreak of avian flu once every three to four years . why do people argue in such a way ? is this really a rule rather than an exception ? is it really true that if the live chicken or poultry trade continues to exist , avian flu will definitely break once every three to four years ? this is nothing but a defeatist mentality , a mere excuse to shirk responsibilities , which does not stand to reason at all . is it really true that not any improvement has been made since the last outbreak of avian flu ? this is definitely not true . we notice that the government has put in place many preventive and quarantine measures ; we also notice that the hygiene conditions in poultry farms and wholesale markets have been greatly improved . following the last outbreak of avian flu , many people suddenly realized that the problem of poor hygiene in many poultry farms and wholesale markets has existed for decades . but then , lots of improvements have been made over the past few years . that is why i do not think that it is just a coincidence that the origin of the virus this time around is not found in poultry farms and wholesale markets . in contrast , as many members have pointed out , the hygiene conditions of the poultry stalls in retail markets have not shown any marked improvements over the past few years . the government is not the only one to be held responsible for this , and we should not shift the blame to stall operators either . various factors have led to the lack of significant improvements in the hygiene conditions of markets over the past few years . so , i do not think that it is just a coincidence that the virus was first detected in the markets run by the food and environmental hygiene department . i am sure that both the original motion moved by mr wong yung - kan and the amendment moved by mr tommy cheung today are not meant to shift all the blame on to the government . following the recent outbreak of avian flu , many members have held many meetings with people engaged in the poultry industry , including those belonging to the poultry feed , retail , wholesale and conveyance sectors . we can all testify that during all these meetings , all from the poultry industry , including operators and employees , did show a very strong intention of improving their mode of operation . they put forward many improvement proposals , and they certainly did not intend to shift the blame on to the government . but are proposals in the motion and the amendment really feasible ? or , should they be implemented at all ? or , if they are to be put into practice , why do we not ask the government to be responsible for the work ? mr albert chan : madam president , for two weeks , avian flu has been discussed as an important subject in this council . last week , this topic was discussed by the finance committee , and this week , at this meeting of the whole council , a formal motion on it is once again discussed . that avian flu , commonly called " chicken plague " , has still to be discussed as such an important subject in a legislature in the 21st century is really something very saddening and ironical . most people would think that such problems should only occur in backward countries or ancient agricultural societies . their occurrence in a metropolis will only show that the systems put in place by the government and its handling of the problems are plagued with loopholes . to handle the crisis arising from this chicken plague , the government has had to spend $240 million , which is a very big sum . simple calculations tell us that with $240 million , we can build 26 schools , or meet the cssa payments to 3 000 families for one year . this type of expenditure could have been avoided , but why have there been two outbreaks of avian flu in a matter of just four years ? it is hoped that the government can learn from the bitter experience and make thorough - going improvements . actually , as mentioned by quite a number of members , the avian flu issue is connected with many policies and measures , and it has been in existence for many years . i remember that when the yeung uk road market was inaugurated in 1990 , the chicken stall operators there have lodged lots of complaints . the yeung uk road market is one of the three markets where avian flu was first detected this time around . but the yeung uk road market was completed as recently as 1990 , and it is quite a modern market already . the main reason for constructing this market years back was that the government had to resettle the hawkers in the area ; for this reason , several dozen chicken stalls were moved to the market at that time . in 1990 , when the market was completed , the poor ventilating system of the whole market was the cause of most complaints from stall operators . this was something that happened as early as 10 years ago . and , the poor ventilating system of the chicken slaughter room there was one of the biggest causes of discontent and grievances among stall operators . i went to the chicken slaughter room a couple of times then , and all i saw there was thick steam all around , which reduced one 's visibility to less than 5 ft . members know that chicken stall owners all put their stoves and boilers in the slaughter room , because they will first slit the throats of their chickens and drain their blood , and then bring the chickens to the slaughter room for de-feathering in hot water before bringing them out again for sale . all the 20 or so stall operators at the yeung uk road market did their work in the same slaughter room , but the ventilating system of this newly completed market was far from good enough at that time . it was only after repeated complaints and with the assistance of district board members that the government eventually agreed to spend several million on improving the ventilating system of the market . i really fail to understand the reason why a market with such advanced facilities , designed by so many professionals , should have developed into such a problem . and , even after the installation of additional ventilating facilities , stall operators are not entirely satisfied . this is especially the case in summer , when the ventilating system of the chicken slaughter room is unable to provide adequate ventilation . the chicken slaughter room is just the tip of an iceberg . i am sure that people must have visited markets in many districts in hong kong , and i am sure that they will notice a very serious ventilating problems in all these markets , whether old or new . over the years , we have been putting forward many requests to the government on behalf of the stall operators in different markets . but , invariably , in each case , it took us a very long time before the government finally entertained our request . it is hoped that following the bitter experience this time around , especially after it has been forced to spend $240 million on remedial measures , the government can install some facilities which can really improve the overall ventilation of our markets , for with poor ventilation , germs and viruses will spread very easily . madam president , having criticized the government so much , i must praise it for one matter - its handling of the recent crisis arising from avian flu is markedly better than what it did last time . the decisive actions taken by the government this time have cost it millions of dollars in compensation . in order to bring the situation under control and solve the problem , the government launched a very large - scale operation within a very short time . during the operation , many government workers worked very hard , which is why i must take this opportunity to express my thanks to them . and , i also wish to express my appreciation of their performance . concerning compensation , the various political parties in the legislative council have taken a rare move in forming an alliance to exert pressure on the government , pressing it to make concessions over the protection for the affected employees . naturally , the final settlement scheme is still not perfect , but at least there is a bit more protection for some of the affected employees . madam president , just when the avian flu incident was going on , the government promulgated a logo for hong kong . members should know that the logo depicts a flying dragon , with the words of " ߧ�� / hk " printed below it . when i chatted with my friends at that time , they all said that upon close examination , the logo could look like a dragon , but it could also simply be a chicken cornered by a butcher , with feathers standing up and mouth wide open because of pains . such a comment sounds really interesting , for $9 million was spent on the design of the logo , but the final product is looked upon by some as a " chicken with avian flu " which is cornered by a butcher . the hong kong government has been trying to promote hong kong as a modern city always on the move . therefore , i hope that avian flu will never break out again , or else hong kong will certainly become a " city of avian flu " . thank you , madam president . miss chan yuen - han : madam president , in the avian flu incident this time , the two public officers sitting in this chamber now are the major figures in the " opposite camp " with whom we dealt with . so i would like to talk about them first . in handling the avian flu incident this time , the government has made concessions repeatedly when our opinions differed . there was a night when i talked with mrs stella hung kwok wai - ching as late as well past 11 pm and she said that we might go on talking . i think her attitude deserves our praise . however , i would also like to make some criticisms . the avian flu incident has been effectively and speedily handled this time , and that is because the government has learned the lessons from the avian flu incident in 1997 . however , there are still some problems which are left unsolved . and that has made us worried . for example , the issue of centralized slaughtering has been put forward for consultation as soon as the incident is over . as members of the federation of trade unions ( ftu ) , we are opposed to the idea . a while ago i heard outside the chamber the ideas presented by our party chief mr jasper tsang on gourmet food and health . i think we cannot simply say that the outbreak of avian flu is due to live chickens and so centralized slaughtering should be adopted . this shows that we have not considered the issue of whether we can find a solution to all the related problems as a result of this incident , and the fruit of such consideration could make us stand out among other places which have been hit by avian flu . i think we have something unique in ourselves . if the government can handle the incident effectively , the areas which need to be improved will gradually become better . the question is that the government has not learned the lesson regarding the causes leading to the outbreak of avian flu in 1997 , nor has it learned the lesson from the views put forward by the poultry trade in 1997 on the compensation package . after the outbreak of avian flu last time , the labour sector asked why no compensation was given to workers in the compensation package proposed by the government . the government has not learned a lesson from that . at that time many of the people in the trade were in urgent need of money to tide over their difficulties , and so we were forced to agree to the compensation package . however , the views we expressed at that time should be recorded and these views should be considered when the compensation package is formulated this time . i have said earlier that there are two sides to every coin . in 1997 when problems arose , the poultry trade and the public had put forward a lot of views . the views raised were unlike those put forward by the government that centralized slaughtering should be adopted . views like tracing the source of avian flu were put forward . unfortunately , these are not adopted . presently there are a lot of rumours on the sources of avian flu . from what we can see , the farms in the mainland which supply chickens to hong kong seem to be doing their job well . however , we have also heard of unquarantined chickens being swapped or passed off as quarantined chickens . i do not know whether this is true or not . some people say that when farms which are considered to be qualified to deliver chickens to hong kong do not have enough chickens for such purpose , they will find some chickens from other farms to pass off as their own chickens . is this really the case ? the legislative council has set up a subcommittee to follow up the engineered works left over by the two former municipal councils and there is a panel on food safety and environmental hygiene . members from these two committees have raised the point to the government that the ventilation problem in the markets must be solved . the market in tai shing street belongs to my constituency and the stuffy air in that market is something we all know . the government is also well aware of the conditions of the chicken stalls there . but when the panel and the subcommittee raised the issue to the government , the government replied that the problem of installing air - conditioning system is being studied . in 1997 , when hong kong was hit by avian flu , foreign countries declared hong kong as an epidemic city . we were greatly distressed . the poultry trade raised a lot of suggestions , but the government did not seem to consider any of these , nor did it adopt them . when the two municipal councils were abolished , the problem was transferred to the legislative council . i am a member of the panel and the subcommittee and i have put forward my views many times , but the government has not paid any serious attention to the management and air circulation problem in the markets . these include the entire system of quarantine , labelling and transportation of the imported poultry , as well as the problems found in the markets . when these problems remain unsolved , the government is putting forward the idea of centralized slaughtering . in my opinion , not only will the centralized slaughtering system destroy the poultry trade , it will also destroy hong kong . i would like to turn to another subject and maybe i should emphasize how serious the problem is . in the past when urban development was to take place , many groups put forward a lot of views , but none of them was adopted . what the government is interested in is only property development . and so much of our heritage has been destroyed . after the establishment of the urban renewal authority , it has stated that it will preserve places of historical and cultural interest and will not just demolish buildings , despite this claim , however , for some time we have taken a course that we do not want to . by the same token , are we going to adopt centralized slaughtering as a panacea for all our problems ? i do not think we should . i hope very much that the government can consider our views . i would also like to raise one point and that is : the government says that it wants to turn hong kong into a financial centre and that it will be committed to the development of high - technology and to make hong kong a so - called new manhattan . but if the government wants to implement centralized slaughtering , then what is going to happen to those grass - roots workers whose number stands at over 1 million ? for tens of thousands of workers will lose their jobs . what are we going to do about this ? all these problems should be considered by the government . in addition to that , i would like to talk about the compensation package this time . i do not want to talk about the amount of the compensation , i just want to ask why workers are not included in this compensation package . the government tells us that it does not want to intervene in the numerous rounds of negotiations held . but i wish to state that it is not a question of whether the government should intervene or not , it is a question of whether we want to address the problems we have . there are some workers who have no one to care for them and mrs hung knows this very well . we have held many discussions on the issue of what we should do to help these workers . the government recognizes that this issue does exist , and the issue does not surface as a result of this incident , it has already been pointed out by someone during the last avian flu incident . the only problem is that it has not been properly addressed . the present compensation package brings out the bone of contention that we have in this assembly . people from outside will not be able to understand what we are talking about , they think that we are saying something not sensible , just like what dr lo wing - lok has said earlier . however , people may come up with a different conclusion , especially after i have showed them the workers in the markets . i would like to tell mrs hung and the public officers that in this incident , the government has already intervened . for if they have not done so , the ftu would not have given its support to the amended package proposed later . therefore , i think they should admit the fact that they have indeed intervened . even as they have intervened , they have not done what we have expected , and that is to deal with the issue of compensation to be made out to workers as a separate issue . those casual workers , that is , those who work for less than 18 hours for a continuous period of four weeks are the ones we should take care of . i take these workers to the social welfare department every day and that is what i do . i would like mrs hung to know that there is a great number of these workers . my present task is to bring them to the social welfare department every day . my wish in bringing them there everyday is that when the government is to reach any conclusion on this issue , it should not hastily think that everything has been resolved . finally , i would like to ask the government two questions . the first one is , can the decision to implement centralized slaughtering not be made in haste ? for these are some issues which we need to consider and reach some conclusions . secondly , why are the workers in the poultry trade being treated so unfairly ? madam president , we support the original motion and the amendment . thank you . mr ng leung - sing : madam president , i had originally intended not to speak - mr lee cheuk - yan happens not to be here in this chamber . as some honourable members responded to the speech delivered by dr lo just now , i want to take part in the discussion as well . after learning a lesson from the 1997 incident , the government has responded swiftly to the outbreak of avian flu last month . with the close co-operation among various government departments and proper co-ordination , the government has been able to slaughter chickens within a short period of time to effectively curb the spreading of the virus . it is fortunate that no one has died as a result of this outbreak . judging from the chicken - slaughtering action alone , we can see that the establishment of the environment and food bureau to centralize the management of policies related to food and environmental hygiene helps enhance administrative efficiency . it is however regrettable and disturbing to note that we know very little about the real source of the two outbreaks . after the outbreak of avian flu in 1997 , the mainland has taken a series of additional measures with respect to the quarantine of poultry supplied to hong kong . as members are all aware , a number of measures for strengthening management have been adopted . they include the setting up of a registration system for feeding grounds , the introduction of separate quarantine , sampling examination , packaging surveillance , centralized barging , departure inspection , and so on . yet there eventually came another outbreak of avian flu . views appear to be divided in hong kong over how the virus has been triggered and whether the virus has originated from the mainland or locally . some public opinions and reports hold that the virus has come from the mainland , yet they lack substantial evidence to support what they say . on the other hand , a lot of people think that the virus might have been triggered off during local conveyance , or in the wholesale or retail markets . for instance , there are some who hold the view that the virus can be easily triggered off in hot weather because of the size and number of poultry stalls , the unsatisfactory sanitary conditions , and the poor ventilation of local markets . on the other hand , some people think that the spreading of the virus has been caused by the improper cleansing of bird cages in wholesale markets and market stalls , and the accumulation of large stock of chickens . in any case , the truth is that the government has so far been unable to come up with a scientific and concrete conclusion with respect to the source and causes of the avian flu . even though the government has decisively taken the effective measure of chicken slaughtering , it is still unable to guarantee that the avian flu will not appear for a third time . the relevant trades and the whole community will still need to pay a high price for this . therefore , to trace the origin is of utmost importance . in order to achieve this , the government should not focus on the supply of chickens by the mainland only by looking to the mainland for causes whenever problems occur . it should , at the same time , strengthen surveillance with respect to local conveyance , wholesale and retail , examine and formulate a standardized process of operation in line with hygiene standards with the ultimate goal of effectively preventing the outbreak of the virus and effectively tracing the origin whenever the virus is detected . another issue of public concern triggered off by the recent outbreak of avian flu concerns compensation offered to the trade . one of the most prominent points is that there are no concrete mechanism and standard with respect to the determination of the amount of ex-gratia allowance . this gives the public the impression that the government can exercise great discretion in handling the matter and disputes often arise easily . obviously , the government has to take further follow - up action and improvement measures to tackle the problem . in principle , if , under normal circumstances , fresh or packaged food is found to be unable to meet hygiene standards or having other problems that will harm public health , retailers , wholesalers and manufacturers are obliged to recall their products voluntarily . in this process , the community is not obliged to give compensation or subsidy . this is because the relevant trades must bear associated risks in the course of operating their business . the trade has its unique way of operating live poultry business . in order to tackle avian flu , it is also necessary for the government to carry out mass slaughtering . as the source of the avian flu is still uncertain , the government can only choose to kill all chickens . as in the case of natural disaster , there is nothing the government can do but to grant allowance . as a matter of principle , however , the community has put in place a set of environmental and food hygiene standards and has the right to ask the relevant trades to comply with the relevant standards before they are allowed to operate . this is the major responsibility of the operators who want to make profits . regrettably , it seems to me that the original motion and the amendment are trying to avoid mentioning the responsibilities of the trade . there must be a reasonable and clear basis for the granting of compensation or subsidy to individual trades . the government must act with caution when society instead of the trade is asked to bear the operating costs . this is exactly an integral part of a clear concept on goverance . therefore , i have reservations about the original motion and the amendment for they have only made an appeal to the government while failing to ask people in the trade to share out the work and co-operate with one another before the source of the incident could be identified . madam president , i so submit . dr raymond ho : madam president , the avian flu is a terrible virus . it kills and may be transferred without warning from fowls to people . when the avian flu attacked hong kong in 1997 , six people died . to prevent the spread of the disease , the government then killed all chickens and other fowls . now , the government takes the same steps to tackle the problem but with greater determination and swiftness . as a result , there is no victim this time , which is something to be commended . however , killing fowls is only a temporary measure while exterminating the virus is a permanent one . four years ago , the hong kong government killed all fowls in hong kong and lost a large sum of money . worse still , hong kong 's image was tarnished ; but what did it get in return ? is the avian flu this time not more severe than the one last time ? if the avian flu attacks again in future , will other innocent fowls be victimized once more ? will the government have to deal out large sums of compensation again ? madam president , at the meeting of the finance committee last friday , the government applied for a new financial commitment , which was a large sum , as compensation and ex gratia payments to poultry operators affected . did the authorities foresee , four years ago , that they have to pay a heavy price today for the avian flu ? if we could put the clock back , i would spend the same sum on preventive rather than remedial work . for me , i would spend the money on work such as improving the hygiene and ventilation in our markets . people who have never been to the markets would not know the unsatisfactory conditions of the markets . hong kong should have learned a lesson after the outbreak of the avian flu in 1997 and there should not be a second outbreak . why did it happen again in four years ? i trust this has to do with the hygiene in our markets and the way poultry operators operate . to a certain extent , our market hygiene is related to the facilities in our markets , such as the availability of air - conditioning and proper drainage systems . it is also related to the co-operation and self-discipline demonstrated by our poultry operators . after the outbreak of the avian flu four years ago , the government urged poultry operators to clean their shops and cages frequently and wear gloves and white gowns in handling chickens . that is due to the fact that it is part of hong kong people 's nature to take opportunities well and poultry operators regard time as money . thus , given the very high rents for shops in hong kong , poultry operators may find government advice incongruous with their operating principles , for cleaning stalls and cages is time - consuming while wearing gloves and white gowns would cause delays . understandably , they will not heed the advice of the government . thus , one can easily tell whether or not poultry operators will close their stalls for a day periodically for a thorough cleaning of their shops and cages . the answer is clear enough . since the government cannot effectively control the way poultry operators operate , it may be a good idea to change the way poultry operators operate . for example , the government may encourage poultry operators to reduce their stock of live chickens so that as many chickens as possible are sold at the close of business each day to reduce the chance of diseases being spread . the government may also encourage poultry operators to control their purchase to avoid having too many chickens left unsold . if poultry operators can take these steps , i think they may help to avoid a further outbreak of the avian flu . the avian flu has certain negative effects on the reputation of hong kong . so , the hong kong government must face the issue squarely . killing the chickens and paying compensation are only temporary measures . the best step to take is to remove the source generating the virus . i hope that through this discussion , the government and the public may pay more attention to the case in order to avoid a third outbreak of the avian flu . madam president , i so submit . president : does any other member wish to speak ? mrs sophie leung : madam president , i have listened to a number of honourable colleagues who have spoken on the motion today , but i would really like to say sorry , for every time when i have heard them speak so wisely , i would feel a need to add something . many honourable colleagues have said earlier that the motion and the amendment have not mentioned anything about the responsibilities of the poultry trade . only the question of principle has been raised and it seems that the principle has been violated or something like that . what role in fact should the government play in incidents like this ? someone has also raised the point concerning those in the poultry business who deliver live chickens to the hong kong market and what responsibility should they bear to keep the goods ( that is , the chickens ) fresh . discussions like these are in my opinion well - grounded . however , many honourable colleagues , including those who are opposed to the original motion or the amendment , conclude by saying that if no effective method is found to prevent the recurrence of avian flu , then the centralized slaughtering system should be considered . that is almost like saying that all other issues need not be considered . i would like to ask all honourable members who hold such an opinion , are we sure that there is no effective solution available ? have we ever tried other methods which would work out ? in this regard i would like to cite one example . in the summer of 1996 , that should be the year if my memory does not fail me , there was an outbreak of e . ccoli epidemic in tokyo . many children got infected and there were some adults too . the authorities in tokyo quickly took measures which used to be at the research and experimental stages to deal with the problem . they proved to be very effective in stopping the epidemic and were even able to prevent its later recurrence . i think for the authorities in tokyo , that was a great success . moreover , the people can continue with their eating habits and there is no need to change all the eating habits just because of some germs . madam president , with your permission , i would like to say that there are actually some other effective solutions . in 1998 , when hong kong was hit by avian flu , the public suggested that this approach should be considered , but the government ignored it completely . this time when the avian flu incident occurred , i talked to people at all levels and i said to officials from many departments that this approach should be considered . it is because if this approach is adopted , it is likely that the spread of this virus can be checked in the chicken farms and markets . if this is proved to be effective , it can be introduced in chicken farms for cleansing . in the course of the outbreak of the epidemic , we can see that it is clear that the virus came from the faeces of chickens and waterfowls and subsequently the chickens got infected . in the government 's efforts to prevent the outbreak of avian flu for a third time , it seems that the government has not given the approach a thorough study . i hope very much that the government will do so . besides , i would like to remind the government that the japanese government used a kind of ozone technology to deal with the problem in 1996 . it was in fact a very simple technology . afterwards the fda of the united states also uses this ozone technology in many of its measures in protecting food . therefore , i think this approach should be considered . the second point i wish to mention is about the point made by many honourable members earlier that the government has not taken any effectively measures . i believe in the first outbreak of avian flu in 1998 , there were many members of this council who reminded the government to pay attention to a number things . the government has certainly adopted some measures which are appropriate , for if not , the outbreak of avian flu this time would not have been detected so quickly . however , the approach taken by the government can also be said to have given the public an unfavourable impression , for the public will think that the government has not really looked into how avian flu can be prevented . they will ask whether any more effective measures are available to prevent the occurrence of avian flu at its source . they will also ask whether any attempt has been made to find out the source of the virus . some members of the public have talked with me concerning the avian flu incident . they ask why is the way in which the government handles the incident often gives people the impression that it is just trying to settle the matter in haste , and then the case will subsequently be closed . it seems that the government is doing nothing to convince us that it is looking for a real and long - term solution . in this regard , i would like to bring out a point expressed by the public and that is , is the government just trying to settle incidents this way and close the file on them ? i hope it will reflect on this mentality and to see whether its actions are affected by this culture . the government should really reflect on this and to see how it can give confidence to the people that government officers are not just trying to settle the matter but that the root of the problem will be thoroughly looked into , and that they will positively try to look for a solution . madam president , i so submit . president : does any other member wish to speak ? ( no member responded ) president : mr wong yung - kan , you may now speak on the amendment moved by mr tommy cheung . the time limit is five minutes . mr wong yung - kan : madam president , the motion i move used to contain four points and mr tommy cheung has amended it to five . irrespective of the fact that the motion may contain four or five points , there is a common ground between mr cheung and i and that is , after the outbreak of avian flu we have tried our best to help the trade engage in a dialogue with the government and to look for an effective solution . in mr cheung 's amendment , he has deleted the idea of a local poultry quarantine system which i think is the most important , nonetheless , he mentions the idea again in his speech . why do i bring up the issue of a local poultry quarantine system ? it is because a local poultry quarantine system and a poultry quarantine system in the mainland are one and the same thing and the two should be linked . we find that the local and mainland quarantine officers , including the veterinary surgeons of our agriculture , fisheries and conservation department ( afcd ) have only taken samples from those chicken cages at the top of the pile for quarantine purposes . that is merely done for the sake of convenience . as a matter of fact , quarantine work done in the past was not like that . the quarantine sampling size was greater and not just chickens from five or six cages were sampled , but that one or two chickens from each cage of a large number of chicken cages would be sampled for quarantine purposes . however , the afcd deserves to be commended for one measure it have taken and that is the system of taking samples every 15 days . when live chickens are delivered to the farms , they will be put in quarantine . then for every 15 days thereafter , sample testing is done and the numbers will all be put down in record . in addition , there are some honourable colleagues who have raised the point of chickens to be delivered at night time . according to practice in local farms , the person responsible must inform the government three days before chickens are to be delivered and they can only do so after permission is obtained from the government . that is something very clear . however , we have discovered a problem and that has been mentioned by mr tommy cheung earlier , and that is the problem of selling chilled and live poultry meat at the same counter . at present , we can see that after chilled chickens , ducks and geese are defrosted , they would be put on sale on the tables for fresh meat . incidentally , dr lo is not in the chamber and i would like to ask him whether it is true when seen from the medical perspective that germs would start to breed and so viruses would be caused and leading to cross - infection when chilled and live poultry are put together . i read a piece of news yesterday that south korea pointed out that the chilled geese from china were found to carry h5n1 virus . a while ago some officials in hong kong said that 24 samples were taken from chickens , geese , ducks and other kinds of poultry from the local trade and sent to a laboratory in a university to see if any germs were there . it was found that all 24 samples were tested positive . that happened at a later time and not two or three months ago . in fact , people in the trade have talked to the government departments to remind them that they should pay attention to some problems . i agree with mr tommy cheung that the government should take some action . during the motion debate , some honourable colleagues queried whether we were shirking our responsibilities and putting the blame on the government . they even were of the opinion that we thought that the trade was not responsible and that the government should bear all the blame . that is not what we mean . both mr tommy cheung and i as well as all members of the council were actively involved in the incident and we were all working hard to find out how things could get better . we also made some suggestions . we did not ask the government to take all the responsibilities . are we not being sensible when we demand that the conditions in the markets should be improved ? we think we are sensible . last saturday i went to the chicken farms and then to the market in fa yuen street . i found that there were no chickens in the market and the poultry stalls were all closed . the market was so hot and stuffy . this morning i went to the market in yue wan estate and i found that there were no chickens for sale . the stalls there were also very hot and stuffy . the government should therefore pay more attention to the sanitary conditions in the market as well as the problem of rats because rats are running all over the place . as for the amendment moved by mr tommy cheung today , i would not comment on it . i only hope that the trade will handle the incident effectively . and that is what we think . one thing unusual is that in this incident , 10 trade organizations can sit down and discuss how they can solve the problem together with the government . i will not oppose to the amendment moved by mr tommy cheung , for my only wish is that we can join hands to deal with the matters effectively . thank you , madam president . secretary for the environment and food : madam president , first of all , i have to thank honourable members for expressing their valuable views on this motion . the avian flu incident has lasted precisely three weeks since the announcement of the closure of the yeung uk road market , fa yuen street market and smithfield road market on 16 may and the announcement of further measures to close all retail outlets for live poultry on 18 may to prevent the spreading of avian flu among chickens . following the killing of mature poultry in local farms on 30 may , the slaughter has finally come to an end . we have destroyed more than 1.37 million poultry . however , we have taken only the first step in enhancing the protection of public health subsequent to the detection of h5n1 virus . today , i would like to extend my sincere gratitude for mr wong yung - kan for moving the motion and for mr tommy cheung for moving the amendment to give me an opportunity to summarize the developments of the incident and report to honourable members our follow - up work . the public in general is very concerned that the retail shops for poultry should be reopened as soon as possible . first , i would like to inform members of the work progress in this area . to start with , i must stress that although we are committed to reopening retail shops for live poultry expeditiously to minimize the impact on the public and operators of the poultry trade , our prerequisite is that public health must be safeguarded . to this end , we must ensure that h5n1 virus detected in the recent outbreak is eradicated completely before we allow resumption of business . in preparation for the expeditious reopening of poultry retail outlets , the food and environmental hygiene department ( fehd ) has taken three measures : first , the fehd firmly believes that the hygiene conditions of poultry shops must be radically improved for the effective prevention of the spread of avian flu virus . to this end , two rounds of comprehensive cleansing and disinfection have been carried out by stallholders under the supervision of the fehd . in addition , a special inspection team comprising veteran surgeons and senior health inspectors has been appointed by the fehd to inspect these shops to ensure that the highest hygiene standard is met . the relevant work has been progressing smoothly . shops passing the hygiene test will be required to undergo the third round of cleansing before reopening . the entire cleansing operation is expected to be completed within this week . second , as exceedingly high temperature will affect the health of poultry and even cause death , the fehd will endeavour to improve the ventilation of poultry stalls to maintain air circulation and slow down the rise in room temperature . insofar as the relevant work is concerned , the fehd has , assisted by the electrical and mechanical services department , carried out cleansing for the ventilation systems for poultry stalls in all markets . in order to further improve the hygiene of stalls to arrest the spread of the virus , the fehd has , assisted by the architectural services department , carried out minor improvement works in poultry stalls and slaughter chambers , including replacing and mending damaged floor tiles , old wall tiles and drain valves , and installing additional exhaust fans in some slaughter chambers . such works are expected to be completed in the coming few days . third , to enhance the trade 's awareness and general knowledge of hygiene is also a prerequisite for keeping poultry shops in a permanent hygienic condition . the fehd has already started organizing hygiene seminars for operators of the poultry trade . the contents of such seminars include the conveyance , storage , slaughter and disposal of poultry , and the hygiene requirements of poultry shops . such seminars will help operators to manage poultry properly and prevent cross - infection of live poultry after the reopening of the shops . in addition , the agriculture , fisheries and conservation department ( afcd ) has carried out laboratory tests in the markets by putting some healthy chickens in 13 chicken stalls to see if there is any infection . retail outlets for live poultry are expected to resume business in mid - june if everything goes well . madam president , whether before the outbreak of avian flu or at present , we firmly believe that we have one of the most comprehensive and effective surveillance system for avian flu in the world . a series of corresponding surveillance measures are already in place in farms and at such levels ranging from importation to retail and wholesale markets . nevertheless , we will take this opportunity to see what further improvement measures can be taken . first , poultry raised in local farms . i must stress that there was no sign of poultry being infected in local farms in the recent outbreak . at present , local poultry have to be tested in batches for antibodies of h5 avian flu virus within seven days before they are released to the market for sale . in addition , staff of the afcd inspect local farms at an interval of once per every two weeks on average under a closely monitored system . if necessary , we will strengthen work in this area . subsequent to this incident , the afcd will strengthen publicity on the prevention of poultry diseases and the importance of keeping high hygiene standards in farms . second , quarantine for imported poultry . at present , live poultry imported from the mainland must come from registered farms operated under the state administration for entry - exit inspection and quarantine ( ciq sa ) and accompanied by health certificates issued by the ciq sa . every consignment must be segregated from other poultry five days prior to the issue of the health certificates . in addition , the ciq sa will collect blood samples five days before the poultry are transported to hong kong and issue certificates to prove that the chickens are free from avian flu infection . the fehd will randomly collect blood samples from every consignment and have them subject to laboratory tests for antibodies of h5 avian flu virus . imported live poultry will be kept in wholesale markets until the results of the laboratory tests are found to be satisfactory . this is to ensure that no chickens infected with avian flu can enter the markets . we have been keeping close liaison with the ciq sa in the mainland for the purpose of putting curbing measures into actual implementation . we will negotiate with the relevant mainland authorities to strengthen the relevant work . for instance , studies are being carried out to examine whether it is possible for the government to conduct more random serological tests on live chickens at the boundary , to put in place a mechanism for conducting random serological tests on chickens kept in wholesale markets , carry out more inspections on poultry farms in the mainland , and so on . as for the taking of quarantine measures for imported chilled ducks and geese , i must point out that the risk of chilled poultry carrying avian flu virus is much lower than that of live birds . chilled ducks and geese imported from the mainland must be accompanied by official health certificates issued by the mainland poultry health authorities certifying that the ducks and geese are fit for human consumption . the fehd will verify the certificates at entry points and inspect the ducks and geese . as for the request of removing the necks of imported frozen chickens , as i stated earlier in the debate , the possibility of frozen poultry causing avian flu is extremely low . in addition , avian flu virus is usually found in the intestines and internal organs of poultry . therefore , removing the necks from frozen chickens cannot help reduce the risk of live chicken infection . at the same time , we will endeavour to curb the illegal importation of live and chilled poultry and make sure that such poultry must go through our quarantine system and are fit for human consumption . the afcd and fehd will continue to work in close liaison with the customs and excise department ( c & ed ) and exchange information to help the c & ed carry out anti-smuggling operations . third , the market surveillance system . under the existing surveillance system , we will collect samples from wholesale outlets and markets on a regular basis to see if any infected birds have entered the markets . we have been able to detect h5n1 virus with the help of the existing surveillance system . but still we will review our existing practice and recommend improvement measures . for instance , we will strengthen the reporting system for dead chickens and conduct more post-mortem examination on dead chickens . just now , some members talked about the process of poultry conveyance , the cleansing and transportation of bird cages , the strengthening of the labelling system , and so on . i would like to hold a brief discussion with honourable members here . insofar as the conveyance of imported live chickens is concerned , according to the existing guidelines issued by the fehd to transport operators , each bird cage can carry 11 to 14 live chickens from mainland farms to hong kong . however , the actual number will depend mainly on the weight and size of the chickens . generally speaking , transport operators have all along been adhering to the relevant guidelines . in accordance with the " through - train " mode of conveyance as cited by mr tommy cheung , live chickens imported from a certain farm shall be conveyed in the same truck to go through various stages from random checks at man kam to to their arrival at the cheung sha wan temporary poultry wholesale market . according to our understanding , whenever possible , live chickens are usually carried by the same truck from mainland farms to cross the boundary at man kam to until they reach the wholesale markets . however , as some mainland farms are situated far away from hong kong , the seal put on live chickens from these farms will be broken at mainland quarantine stations at man kam to under the supervision of the mainland quarantine authorities and moved to trucks that can enter hong kong and put under seal again . chickens transported in these vehicles will be similarly subject to bird flu tests at man kam to and carry official health certificates issued by the mainland . therefore , it is impossible for chickens not yet quarantined for avian flu virus to enter the local markets in the course of conveyance . as for the cleansing of plastic bird cages , high pressure jets and electrical cleansing machines are available in the cheung sha wan temporary poultry wholesale market to enable wholesalers to thoroughly cleanse and disinfect their stalls and plastic cages . staff of the afcd will inspect cleansed cages . those not yet thoroughly cleansed will be returned for further cleansing . the afcd and wholesalers are exploring the possibility of engaging contractors to provide cleansing service for bird cages and to supervise cleansing work directly . in addition , wholesalers will cease business every 10 days , that is thrice a month , to enable the whole market to be cleansed and disinfected thoroughly . therefore , the overall condition of the wholesale markets in term of the cleansing and disinfecting work carried out is satisfactory . we will continue to work hard in carrying out cleansing and disinfection work and will not relax in our efforts . as for the poultry - labelling system , we think the proposal raised by mr wong yung - kan with respect to the setting up of a poultry - labelling system for local and mainland farms to trace the source of avian flu virus will not achieve this effect . the reasons are as follows : first , a large number of chickens from various farms are mixed together in the wholesale and retail outlets . chickens will be subject to cross - infection easily if avian flu virus is found in the outlets . therefore , even if a chicken from a certain farm is found to have avian flu symptoms , it does not mean that the farm in question is the source of avian flu . therefore , the labelling system cannot help ascertain the source of the virus . second , avian flu virus is actually present everywhere in nature . infected areas may be found in farms , in the process of conveyance , or in wholesale or retail outlets . therefore , even if chickens are labeled , we will still be unable to ascertain the single source of the virus . the labeling system cannot help detect and prevent the occurrence of avian flu . third , the labelling system will impose an additional burden on the trade . moreover , there will be enforcement difficulty in , for instance , producing evidence with respect to false labelling . one point i would like to stress is that we have already put in place an effect surveillance system in line with international standards . the labelling system will not render any help for such work . i would also like to say a few words on the handling of ducks and geese . as these poultry are natural carriers of avian flu virus , we have implemented the policy of segregating ducks and geese from live chickens at all levels from importation to slaughtering since early 1998 to prevent chickens from being infected . subsequent to the recent incident , we will consider requiring the carcasses and internal organs of ducks and geese to be packed separately before they are sold in live chicken stalls in order to further minimize the risk of cross - infection . apart from this , we propose that the internal organs of ducks and geese reacting positively in virus tests be thrown away and not to be sold . madam president , the incident has aroused grave public concern over the hygiene conditions of markets . we will endeavour to upgrade the standards of hygiene and cleanliness of markets . in the past three weeks , we have repeatedly pointed out that we will actively consider the idea of introducing a " business suspension day " to chicken stalls in markets . in other words , chicken stallholders and sellers will make regular arrangements to have all their chickens and poultry sold out by a certain time and not take in any more poultry . the sale of chickens will then be suspended for one or two days so that all chicken stalls will be left vacant for thorough cleansing and disinfection . this practice can help disrupt the spread of avian flu virus among chickens . in this aspect , the fehd has preliminary met with representatives of relevant retail stalls on 29 may . during the meeting , the representatives generally agreed to the proposal of introducing a " business suspension day " . they also proposed that poultry stalls and fresh provision shops in all markets should vacant their stalls and shops on the same day near the end of each month for thorough cleansing . the date shall be fixed by the fehd and the trade upon further discussion . we are also in the course of formulating a new set of guidelines on the hygiene of poultry retail stalls . the proposed measures include : first , poultry stallholders should use handcarts with a sealed bottom to convey poultry and bird cages to keep the passages of the markets clean ; second , bird cages should not contain a large quantity of chickens and stacked too high to prevent air circulation from being affected ; and third , stallholders should report to the fehd the death toll of chickens everyday . after preliminary contact , representatives of the trade have expressed support for the proposed measures . while mr tommy cheung 's amendment urged the government to renovate and improve the existing ventilation systems and other facilities in markets , some members suggested the government to speed up the installation of air - conditioners in markets . i would like to respond to these proposals here . to start with , i want to stress that to maintain air circulation in markets is most important to upgrading the hygiene conditions of markets . however , that does not mean that the hygiene conditions will be undermined if , because of certain environmental constraints or some other reasons , it is impossible for air - conditioners to be installed in certain markets . what matters most is that adequate ventilation systems are in place to ensure good circulation of air . at present , all newly built markets have been installed with air - conditioners . markets with no air - conditioners are equipped with mechanical ventilation or cooling systems instead . these systems can lower the temperature of the markets and improve the circulation of fresh air . in order to further improve the conditions of markets , we will install additional exhaust fan systems and fans in markets if such needs arise . furthermore , we have planned to install additional air - conditioners in 16 markets . we are conducting feasibility studies to ascertain whether individual projects can be implemented . we hope stallholders can fully co-operate with us while the works are in progress to ensure the smooth implementation of the projects . as the improvement measures proposed subsequent to this incident will affect the existing mode of operation , we will actively communicate and discuss with people in the trade . full consultation of the trade has formally commenced on 5 june . i have actually explained each of the proposals to members earlier in my speech . i hope the trade can actively respond to these proposals . i must point out that we rely on the full co-operation of the trade for the effective implementation of these measures . we will not be able to achieve our desired result if we rely solely on the government 's administrative measures . therefore , i very much hope that the trade can fully co-operate with us to improve the existing surveillance system and upgrade the hygiene standards of the markets . i have pointed out repeatedly in the past three weeks that the detection of h5n1 virus has proved the effectiveness of the existing surveillance mechanism . as i pointed out earlier , we will review the reinforcement of the whole set of preventive and surveillance measures and actively upgrade the hygiene standards of the markets . nevertheless , as we pointed out repeatedly before , we cannot stem out the possibility of the occurrence of h5n1 virus so long as live poultry are available for sale . this incident has given the public an opportunity to discuss what long - term measures can be taken to tackle this problem , including whether or not central slaughtering should be adopted . i would like to stress that the government has not taken any position or laid down any timetable at present . members are welcome to engage in more discussion with respect to this issue . we will definitely listen to views expressed by all parties before making a decision . madam president , i would like to express my sincere gratitude for the full co-operation of the trade which has made it possible for the slaughtering and the cleansing of wholesale outlets and markets to be conducted smoothly . i would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the relevant departments , including the fehd , the afcd and the department of health , for their hard work over the past three weeks . i also appreciate the professional advice given to us by academics and experts and the valuable advice expressed by honourable members with respect to the follow - up work . as i said at the very beginning , we have taken only the first step . what matters most is our follow - up work in future . we will endeavour to maintain a high degree of vigilance and continue to devote all our efforts for the prevention and surveillance of avian flu virus . the government is obliged to provide hong kong , as an international cosmopolitan , with a high - standard public health environment . i must reiterate that it is not enough to rely solely on government measures . i would like to appeal to operators of the poultry trade and the general public to work in concert to improve our public health . thank you . president : i now put the question to you and that is : that the amendment , moved by mr tommy cheung to mr wong yung - kan 's motion , be passed . will those in favour please raise their hands ? ( members raised their hands ) president : those against please raise their hands . ( members raised their hands ) mr tommy cheung rose to claim a division . president : mr tommy cheung has claimed a division . the division bell will ring for three minutes . president : will members please proceed to vote . president : have all the voting units lighted up already ? will members please check their votes . if there are no queries , voting shall now stop and the result will be displayed . the voting system has been responding quite slowly today . ( laughter ) functional constituencies : mr kenneth ting , miss margaret ng , mrs selina chow , mr cheung man - kwong , mr hui cheung - ching , mr chan kwok - keung , mrs sophie leung , mr sin chung - kai , mr wong yung - kan , mr howard young , mr lau wong - fat , mrs miriam lau , mr timothy fok , mr law chi - kwong , miss li fung - ying , mr tommy cheung , mr michael mak and mr ip kwok - him voted for the amendment . dr raymond ho , mr eric li , dr lui ming - wah , mr bernard chan and dr lo wing - lok voted against the amendment . mr lau ping - cheung abstained . geographical constituencies and election committee : miss cyd ho , mr albert ho , mr lee cheuk - yan , mr martin lee , mr fred li , mr james to , miss chan yuen - han , mr chan kam - lam , mr jasper tsang , dr yeung sum , mr lau chin - shek , mr lau kong - wah , miss choy so - yuk , mr andrew cheng , mr szeto wah , mr tam yiu - chung , dr tang siu - tong , mr albert chan , mr wong sing - chi , ms audrey eu , mr david chu , mr yeung yiu - chung and mr ambrose lau voted for the amendment . mr ng leung - sing voted against the amendment . the president , mrs rita fan , did not cast any vote . the president announced that among the members returned by functional constituencies , 24 were present , 18 were in favour of the amendment , five against it and one abstained ; while among the members returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections and by the election committee , 25 were present , 23 were in favour of the amendment and one against it . since the question was agreed by a majority of each of the two groups of members present , she therefore declared that the amendment was carried . president : mr wong yung - kan , you may now reply and you have up to four minute 13 seconds . mr wong yung - kan : madam president , i wish to thank the 18 honourable members who have spoken on the issue of the avian flu . counting mr tommy cheung and myself , the number is precisely 20 persons , and that is one third of the number of members of this council . the greatest controversy is that there are some honourable members who oppose the motion because they think that the motion is a trade - related issue and it is not quite proper to discuss it here . honestly speaking , in this incident the trade also gets involved in labour issues and has given its support . i hope honourable members will not think that we are not trying to make things better . i often say that it would be very easy for the government to destroy a trade , it is as easy as pressing a button . however , if an entire trade is to continue to survive , then it would be much more difficult . i hope those honourable colleagues who are opposed to our position or are holding different views from ours would look at the incident from another perspective and will not only look at things superficially . in addition , we are very positive in our response to the government 's suggestions . i also hope the government will consider our views carefully . basically , among the 10 points i have raised , apart from the point on labelling system , all the other nine are similar to the views held by the government . the views put forward in the motion are not simply my personal views , they are views reached after three rounds of discussions made with 10 trade organizations . that shows that there is a consistency between the views shared by the government and the trade , and that everyone supports the efforts made by the government . i once said to people in the trade that if there is a further occurrence of avian flu , everything will be over for all of us . mr tommy cheung joked to me earlier that he might lose more than 1000 voters . one entire group in my constituency would even disappear , too . having said that , i do not think we should look at the issue this way , nor should the poultry trade do so . it is because the scope of the impact is very extensive and far - reaching . so i hope that the government can listen more to the view expressed by different parties and to engage in more dialogues with the trade . there is a food safety advisory committee in the advisory framework of the government , but there is never any trade representatives serving there . i am not quite sure if this is true to say so , but both mr tommy cheung and i are not members of this advisory committee . of course both of us do not necessarily have to serve on this committee , but the question is that there are no trade representatives in it . there are only medical doctors and scholars in it and things are to be handled by these people . that is quite similar to the situation in the environmental assessment advisory committee which we mentioned yesterday . all the related issues are to be handled by the committee members . there is no need for other people to make suggestions . whenever there is any problem in the trade concerned , the way to handle the situation is to be decided by the committee members in accordance with their beliefs and thoughts . would this be a correct approach to take ? i would like to ask the government to consider this point . i hope it can listen to the requests and demands from the trade through different channels . most of the honourable members who have spoken today have indicated their support to the government 's efforts in improving the sanitary conditions in the markets . why did the source of the avian flu this time come from the markets ? i am not trying to shirk responsibilities , but as many honourable colleagues have pointed out , this is precisely because the markets are so stuffy and stinking . when temperature there exceeds more than 40 degrees celsius , it is indeed hard to bear when one walks into it , even if there is no poultry there . i was sweating all over when i walked into a market . it may be due to the fact that i sweat very easily . however , other honourable colleagues have also said that they find the conditions there hard to bear . this morning when i visited a market together with the district councillor mr chung shu - kun , he also said that he found the conditions there intolerable . there are many markets in hong kong which do not have any ventilation facilities and the only means to improve air circulation is the windows . the government should therefore consider how the design for markets can be improved . i call upon all honourable colleagues , including those who oppose to our views , to support us . president : i now put the question to you and that is : that the motion moved by mr wong yung - kan , as amended by mr tommy cheung , be passed . will those in favour please raise their hands ? ( members raised their hands ) president : those against please raise their hands . ( members raised their hands ) president : i think the question is agreed by a majority of each of the two groups of members , that is , those returned by functional constituencies and those returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections and by the election committee , who are present . i declare the motion as amended passed . next meeting president : i now adjourn the council until 2.30 pm on wednesday , 13 june 2001 . you people need not go away in such a haste , i have not risen from my seat yet . ( laughter ) adjourned accordingly at twelve minutes to nine o'clock . annex i written answer written answer by the secretary for education and manpower to miss li fung - ying 's supplementary question to question 2 according to the security bureau , employers of persons who are not lawfully employable may be prosecuted under section 17i of the immigration ordinance ( cap . 115 ) . in connection with the 294 illegal workers who were prosecuted by the immigration department during the period january 2000 to april 2001 , 25 employers were prosecuted , of whom 23 were convicted . the immigration ( amendment ) ordinance 1999 , which was enacted in february 1999 , provided the addition of a new subsection ( 38a (4) ) under section 38a of the immigration ordinance to hold controllers of construction sites liable when persons who are not lawfully employable are found taking employment at the construction sites under their charge . during the period february 1999 to april 2001 , two construction companies were prosecuted under section 38a (4) and one was convicted of the aforesaid offence . annex ii written answer written answer by the secretary for education and manpower to mr lee cheuk - yan 's supplementary question to question 2 according to the security bureau , possession of forged " green cards " or engaging in the production of forged " green cards " are offences under the crime ordinance ( cap . 200 ) . offenders may be prosecuted under sections 71 ( the offence of forgery ) , 73 ( the offence of using a false instrument ) and 75 ( offences of possessing a false instrument ) , as appropriate .
